Time and again it tried to pull itself back into the shelter of the wing, but the wind was relentless.\nThe wind speed was 250mph (400km/h) and the temperature -12C.\nThe snake's body was hammered against the engine, leaving blood stains on the white paint.\nOne passenger, Robert Weber, a website designer in Cairns, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ''The people at the front were oblivious to what was going on but the passengers at the back were all totally focused on the snake and how it might have got on to the aircraft.\n''There was no panic. At no time did anyone stop to consider that there might be others on board.''\nThe president of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, Paul Cousins, said: ''It appears as though the snake has initially crawled up inside the landing bay, maybe housed himself in there, and then crawled into the trailing ledge flap assembly.''\nScrub pythons are Australia's longest snakes.

conceivable way,\" said Orion's programme manager Mark Geyer.\n\"The series of tests has proven the system and will help ensure crew and mission safety for our astronauts in the future.\"\nNasa is preparing Orion for its first trip to space in December, a two-hour, four-orbit flight that will send an unmanned version of the spacecraft more than 5,700km (3,600 miles) into space.\nIt will then be returned to Earth to test the performance of many of the craft's critical systems.\nIn the latest test, over the US Army's Yuma Proving Ground, engineers put additional stresses on the parachutes by allowing the test craft to \"free fall\" for 10 seconds, which increased the vehicle's speed and aerodynamic pressure.\nAfter the free fall, Orion's parachutes deployed, pulling away the spacecraft's forward bay cover, which is critical to the rest of the system performing as required.\nThe test marked the last time the entire parachute sequence will be tested before Orion launches on its first space flight test, called EFT-1, later this year.", "ref_summary": "Nasa says the most difficult test yet of the parachute system for its Orion spacecraft has gone without a hitch.", "gen_summary":

channels, mobile technologies and smartphone apps, adding that retailers were now favouring \"clicks over bricks\".\nBruce Cartwright, head of business recovery services at PwC in Scotland, said: \"The Scottish high street continues its drastic overhaul in response to the advance of online sales and changing consumer demand, with last year's numbers exposing the harsh impact of 'macro' changes on the high street, especially in certain sub-sectors.\n\"Regulation has blindsided the money shops, the advance of technology has hammered some phone operators and the internet continues to dent the clothing sector.\n\"Despite the Scottish economy reflecting healthy, sustainable growth during 2014 and into 2015, the net loss of shops has accelerated.\n\"The insolvencies of Phones4U, Blockbuster, Albemarle & Bond and La Senza - a diverse cross-section of the retail market - epitomise these factors.\"\nHe added: \"Despite the continuing problem of closures, new sub-sectors - such as discount shops and charity shops - keep growing.\n\"The strength of the restaurant and fast-food sectors is also a boost for the high street.\"", "ref_summary": "Scotland's high streets are facing drastic

She says she is not seeking financial compensation but that she will not rest until she gets her baby back.", "ref_summary": "A British father and his wife have accused a doctor at a hospital in El Salvador of swapping their newborn son at the request of child traffickers.", "gen_summary": "A British father and his wife have accused a doctor at a hospital in El Salvador of swapping their newborn son at the request of child traffickers.", "summary_idx": 0, "rel_sent_positions": [1, 3, 10]}, {"id": "xsum__train__34351908__reference__0", "corpus": "xsum", "split": "train", "model": "reference", "original_id": "34351908", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "McClaren, who was only appointed this summer, has guided United to 19th place in the Premier League and they were knocked out of the League Cup by an under-strength Sheffield Wednesday.", "pos": [0, 185], "label": [1, 1, 1]}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "\"To have that knee-jerk reaction and look for a new manager is ridiculous at this point,\" Howey told BBC Sport.", "pos": [186, 297], "label": [1, 1, 1]}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "\"We have to wait until at least Christmas.\"", "pos": [298, 341], "label": [0, 0, 1]}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Howey helped Newcastle win the second-tier title as well as being part of a Magpies side which twice finished as runners-up in the Premier League during the 1990s.", "pos": [342, 505], "label": [1, 1, 1]}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "He believes the Tyneside outfit's players need to \"take a long hard look at themselves\".", "pos": [506, 594], "label": [0, 1, 1]}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "\"Everyone can get beaten and we have already seen that this season but it is the way, attitude and sometimes how easily they go down,\" added Howey.", "pos": [595, 742], "label": [0, 0, 0]}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "\"When I was playing, and even afterwards, teams didn't like coming to St James' Park because it was hostile and it was difficult to win there.", "pos": [743, 885], "label": [0, 0, 0]}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "\"The way Newcastle are playing at the moment, they are basically there for the taking which is horrifically disappointing.

Burton Albion say they have not received an approach from the R's to speak to manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.\nUnder Warnock's leadership, QPR were promoted to the Premier League in 2011 as winners of the Championship, but he was sacked the following January with the club 17th in the top flight.\nHe had been out of management since being dismissed by Crystal Palace in December 2014, after four months in charge.\nAfter joining QPR in an advisory capacity to Ramsey in October, Warnock said \"full-time management doesn't interest me any more\".\nRangers are 13th in the Championship table, eight points off the play-off places.", "ref_summary": "Neil Warnock expects to be in charge of Queens Park Rangers for two more games, BBC Radio London reports.", "gen_summary": "Neil Warnock expects

activity.\nSpeaking to The Wales Report on Wednesday, he said: \"We have reciprocal arrangements with most European countries, and as long as those reciprocal arrangements work I see no reason to intervene and change those.\n\"However for people outside the UK and Europe where we don't have those, we're looking again at charging arrangements.\"\n\"Later in the year I'll get to make a decision on what charging may or may not look like.\"\nBut the health secretary added: \"This is such a marginal area of activity.\"\n\"Really, when you're talking about the central funding of the health service, with the big challenge that we face, the actual conversation about charging people from abroad is an absolute distraction.\"\nAsked whether he would consider charging patients who have illnesses caused by their lifestyle choices, Mr Gething said: \"If you're really saying, for example, that someone with lung cancer who smoked should therefore be charged for their treatment.\n\"I actually think that when you get into real examples like that, people will very quickly say that isn't what I think should happen.\n\"When you think about the practical reality of it, it isn't that simple at all.\"\nMr Gething warned while the Welsh Government had made \"significant additional commitments\" to the health service from its budget, there would be difficult consequences if austerity
