The 43-year-old German is the second driver in F1 history, after Brazil's Rubens Barrichello, to achieve the feat and will be hoping for an upturn in his fortunes in his Mercedes. A superb podium finish at the European Grand Prix has been mixed with retirements in six of 10 races this season and Schumacher is confident he can turn it around on his favorite circuit. \"Spa is like my living room; for me, it's clearly the number one race track in the world,\" Schumacher told the official F1 website. \"It's uncanny how I always seem to have special moments there -- my debut, my first win, a world championship victory and many great races. \"We delivered a good performance in Spa last year; I'll be doing everything possible to drive a strong race,\" he added. Schumacher's first appearance in F1 came at Spa in 1991 for Jordan before he moved to Benetton to win successive titles in 1994 and 1995. He switched to Ferrari the next year and won five further titles with the famous marque before retiring in 2006.

A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury.

It was a time of weariness and confusion, which was reflected in the music and films of 1974. But it also was a period of transition for America as the progressive values that emerged in the 1960s around political awareness and women's rights continued to flourish. A shift in pop culture also was under way, from Beatlemania and Flower Power to disco and what Tom Wolfe dubbed the \"Me\" decade.

It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised.

But the Lions declined to take up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract and did not exactly bend over backwards to retain his services. A history of inconsistency, injuries and off-field concerns led the Lions to allow him enter free agency.

Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!'

The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend.

Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's defense attorneys argue that Gouker acted alone in killing Zwicker. Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him \"very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed.\" The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions. \"They were sitting together on the couch, playing video games.

Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: \u2018British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. \u2018Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.\u2019 Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: \u2018The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.\u2019 As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden \u2013 and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth \u00a31,928. And around 57 per cent of householders surveyed by Lloyds TSB said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.", "ref_summary": "Now outdoor space is more commonly used to store hot tubs, say experts .\nOnly traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens as a result .\nMost only contains four species - daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips .", "gen_summary": "Average one usually contains a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips.", "summary_idx": 3, "rel_sent_positions": [3, 9]}, {"id": "xsum__test__96dab028bb00fdeaf3a8f594250415b33b46bbcb__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "test", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "96dab028bb00fdeaf3a8f594250415b33b46bbcb", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris.", "pos": [0, 114], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.4119685888290405}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a \u00a335million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors, while the north London club are determined not to sell the Frenchman to a domestic rival.", "pos": [115, 345], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.3179050087928772}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "United are considering a move for the France goalkeeper as fears grow over a David de Gea's future, while he is also a long-term target for Paris Saint-Germain.", "pos": [346, 506], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.41489139199256897}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Hugo Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's top keepers with some fine displays .", "pos": [507, 611], "label": [1, 1, 1], "simcse": 0.9431096315383911}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Spurs are determined to keep Lloris at White Hart Lane and will put a \u00a335million price tag on his head .", "pos": [612, 716], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.47217559814453125}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "But Spurs are determined to keep their No 1 at White Hart Lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper.", "pos": [717, 828], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.3541634678840637}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "The current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the \u00a332.6million Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001.", "pos": [829, 953], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.39900144934654236}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "But Tottenham chairman Levy values Lloris even higher than that fee and won't consider any offers for a penny under \u00a335million.", "pos": [954, 1081], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.25637099146842957}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "And it is for that reason United, despite their interest, are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch.", "pos": [1082, 1196], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.16253601014614105}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Daniel Levy (right), alongside Spurs owner Joe Lewis, is known to drive a hard bargain .", "pos": [1197, 1285], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.33858722448349}, {"sentence_idx": 10, "sentence": "Gianluigi Buffon is the world's most expensive keeper after his \u00a332.6m move from Parma to Juve in 2001 .", "pos": [1286, 1390], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.44766971468925476}, {"sentence_idx": 11, "sentence": "Levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in Europe and will not let Lloris leave on someone else's terms.", "pos": [1391, 1507], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.2800392508506775}, {"sentence_idx": 12, "sentence": "His reputation for getting maximum value from the club's assets was underlined when Real Madrid paid a world record \u00a385million for Gareth Bale after a summer of hardball tactics from Levy.", "pos": [1508, 1696], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.5044964551925659}, {"sentence_idx": 13, "sentence": "And the Spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep Lloris, who signed a five-year deal last summer.", "pos": [1697, 1820], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.4499821960926056}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris.

When Mr Cameron answered questions from MailOnline last month he revealed how he watched the\u00a0horrific\u00a0ISIS beheading videos of British hostages to understand what families have been going through. The PM\u00a0defended spending billions on foreign aid, breaking his promise to cut immigration and suggested that we no longer live in what he once called 'broken Britain'. The Tory leader also claimed he was not scared of Nigel Farage, spoke of his love of Gogglebox and Game of Thrones, and the parental woes of listening to the songs of Disney film Frozen over and over again.

Ahead of his interview this week, Mr Clegg is under pressure to show his party will not face wipeout in the general election on May 7.

Earlier this month Bent, 30, questioned whether his absence from the Villa side was a personal snub from Lambert, who said: \u2018I think Darren has got to be honest with himself. If you ask anyone here they\u2019d tell you it\u2019s nothing personal. 'I never stood in his way to go to any other club. The only clubs that came in for him were Championship clubs \u2014 not one Premier League club. That says a lot.\u2019 Bent has joined Championship side Derby on loan until the end of the season .", "ref_summary": "Paul Lambert says that Darren Bent was not good enough .\nAston Villa boss said no Premier League club made an offer .\nBent questioned whether his exile was a personal snub from Lambert .\nThe striker has joined Derby on loan until June .", "gen_summary": "Bent has joined Championship side Derby on loan until the end of the season.", "summary_idx": 2, "rel_sent_positions": [3]}, {"id": "xsum__validation__eb35bd056594a19086452326118fdea73c1cd876__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "validation", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "eb35bd056594a19086452326118fdea73c1cd876", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Hull have announced their intention to appeal against an Football Association charge of failing to control their players during the goalless draw at Leicester on March 14.", "pos": [0, 171], "label": [1, 1, 1], "simcse": 0.7101179957389832}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "The charge arises from a 68th minute incident in which Tigers players surrounded referee Jonathan Moss after Alex Bruce was booked for his challenge on Leicester's Riyad Mahrez.", "pos": [172, 349], "label": [0, 0, 1], "simcse": 0.47614166140556335}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "The club's announcement comes as no surprise in the wake of strong comments made by boss Steve Bruce about the incident on Friday.", "pos": [350, 480], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.2981936037540436}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Hull City have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion .", "pos": [481, 589], "label": [1, 1, 1], "simcse": 0.8849539756774902}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Bruce declared his club would 'vigorously defend' the charge, adding: 'The frustration was that he (Mahrez) was blatantly trying to get somebody sent off.", "pos": [590, 744], "label": [0, 0, 1], "simcse": 0.3810981512069702}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "'We surrounded the referee because it was a perfectly fair challenge'.", "pos": [745, 815], "label": [0, 0, 1], "simcse": -0.003789497073739767}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "The appeal will be heard by an independent regulatory commission.", "pos": [816, 881], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.16405725479125977}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "Alex Bruce reacted furiously to being booked by referee Jon Ross for a  challenge on Riyad Mahrez .", "pos": [882, 981], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.3001895248889923}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "Hull City manager Steve Bruce was unhappy with the behaviour of Leicester players .", "pos": [982, 1065], "label": [0, 0, 0], "simcse": 0.669291615486145}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Hull have announced their intention to appeal against an Football Association charge of failing to control their players during the goalless draw at Leicester on March 14.
