Laura Cowan, 35, of Frederick, was charged last Wednesday with three counts of second degree rape. The same charges were filed against the former Tipton Public Schools educator last July, but in early December a judge threw out the case against Cowan after key witnesses could not be found by the prosecution. Bad teacher: Laura Cowan, 35, a former Oklahoma high school teacher and mother of one, has been charged with three counts of rape for allegedly having sex with two students . Cowan, who has a Master's degree in education from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, started her teaching career in 2010 at Davidson Public Schools. In 2012, she was hired by Tipton Public Schools, where she remained for two years until her resignation last April, reported NewsOK. Investigators say Cowan, the mother of a college-age daughter, admitted to repeatedly having sex with two of her students in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School. Law enforcement officials first learned of the rape allegations against Laura Cowan in April when Tipton Public Schools Superintendent Shane Boothe contacted police and the Tillman County Sheriff's Office about a possible 'inappropriate relationship' between the teacher and one of her students. Workplace tryst: The education allegedly admitted to repeatedly having sex with minors in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School . According to an affidavit prepared in July and obtained by the Frederick Press-Leader, during an interview with police Cowan described having sex with a student in her car during Spring Break 2014. The court document stated that the former teacher also admitted to sleeping with another teenager last January in a Frederick hotel and in her vehicle.

After his side give up a two-goal lead the 46-year-old smashes through the plastic casing of the dugout . The livid NAC manager then turns to his bench to further express his dissatisfaction . However after the hour mark the home side appeared to crumble, letting the visitors claw themselves back into the game with two goals in as many minutes. Clearly incensed by his side's lack of concentration, Maaskant turned to his bench and threw a devastating right hook to the side of the dugout. The 46-year-old clearly packs a punch because his attack sent his fist clean through the plastic casing, cutting his hand. It goes without saying we wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of a Maaskant rant. It's lucky NAC's wobble didn't occur before they headed into the changing rooms at half time... with all those football boots lying around.", "ref_summary": "NAC Breda let slip a two-goal lead, sending boss\u00a0Robert Maaskant wild .\nTheir manager was so upset with what he'd seen he PUNCHED the dugout .\nThe game on Saturday ended 2-2 against last-placed team\u00a0FC Dordrecht .", "gen_summary": "The 46-year-old smashed through the plastic casing of the dugout.", "summary_idx": 3, "rel_sent_positions": [6]}, {"id": "xsum__train__15fb86cbb92775508a4e4118edbe9173ae0f0f06__pegasus-xsum__1", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "train", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "15fb86cbb92775508a4e4118edbe9173ae0f0f06", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "A Chinese toddler needed emergency brain surgery after he was skewered by a chopstick while running.", "pos": [0, 100], "label": [0, 1], "perplexity": 0.9631385803222656}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "Little Li Kaiyi had the chopstick in his mouth when he tripped and fell forward, driving the implement through the roof of his mouth and into his brain.", "pos": [101, 253], "label": [0, 1], "perplexity": -0.6351380348205566}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "The 18-month-old baby was at a friend's house in Yueyang in Hunan Province, China when the terrible accident happened.", "pos": [254, 372], "label": [1, 1], "perplexity": 4.256836891174316}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Li Kaiyi underwent emergency surgery, pictured, after the chopstick ended up getting lodged in his brain .", "pos": [373, 479], "label": [0, 1], "perplexity": 0.21243762969970703}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Surgeons removed the chopstick, right, after an x-ray, left, found it had been driven 2cm into Li Kaiyi's brain .", "pos": [480, 593], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.0566859245300293}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "After dinner, Li was playing with friends when he stumbled and was rushed to hospital where medics performed emergency surgery to remove the chopstick.", "pos": [594, 745], "label": [0, 1], "perplexity": 0.37766551971435547}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "Surgeon Liu Jinfang said: 'The chopstick had 2cm into the brain tissues, and luckily it didn't hurt the brain stem or the major nerves.'", "pos": [746, 882], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.17498445510864258}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "The youngster is expected to be released from hospital shortly and is expected to make a full recovery.", "pos": [883, 986], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.15185928344726562}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "Surgeons expect Li Kaiyi should make a full recovery after his dramatic accident .", "pos": [987, 1069], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.05182170867919922}], "summary_label": [1, 1], "document": "A Chinese toddler needed emergency brain surgery after he was skewered by a chopstick while running.

A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised.

But the Lions declined to take up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract and did not exactly bend over backwards to retain his services. A history of inconsistency, injuries and off-field concerns led the Lions to allow him enter free agency.

Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!'

The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend.

These days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers (file image) Almost 40 per cent of people, including 66 per cent of those aged 18-29, spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it, according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer Alfresia.co.uk. Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: \u2018British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. \u2018Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.\u2019 Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: \u2018The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.\u2019 As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden \u2013 and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth \u00a31,928. And around 57 per cent of householders surveyed by Lloyds TSB said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.", "ref_summary": "Now outdoor space is more commonly used to store hot tubs, say experts .\nOnly traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens as a result .\nMost only contains four species - daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips .", "gen_summary": "Average one usually contains a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips.", "summary_idx": 3, "rel_sent_positions": [3, 9]}, {"id": "xsum__test__96dab028bb00fdeaf3a8f594250415b33b46bbcb__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "test", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "96dab028bb00fdeaf3a8f594250415b33b46bbcb", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris.", "pos": [0, 114], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.15418457984924316}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a \u00a335million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors, while the north London club are determined not to sell the Frenchman to a domestic rival.", "pos": [115, 345], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.055852651596069336}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "United are considering a move for the France goalkeeper as fears grow over a David de Gea's future, while he is also a long-term target for Paris Saint-Germain.", "pos": [346, 506], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.027236223220825195}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Hugo Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's top keepers with some fine displays .", "pos": [507, 611], "label": [1, 1, 1], "perplexity": 3.0416574478149414}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Spurs are determined to keep Lloris at White Hart Lane and will put a \u00a335million price tag on his head .", "pos": [612, 716], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": 0.037998199462890625}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "But Spurs are determined to keep their No 1 at White Hart Lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper.", "pos": [717, 828], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": 0.10281682014465332}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "The current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the \u00a332.6million Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001.", "pos": [829, 953], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.018485546112060547}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "But Tottenham chairman Levy values Lloris even higher than that fee and won't consider any offers for a penny under \u00a335million.", "pos": [954, 1081], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.05300712585449219}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "And it is for that reason United, despite their interest, are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch.", "pos": [1082, 1196], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.027176380157470703}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Daniel Levy (right), alongside Spurs owner Joe Lewis, is known to drive a hard bargain .", "pos": [1197, 1285], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.04157876968383789}, {"sentence_idx": 10, "sentence": "Gianluigi Buffon is the world's most expensive keeper after his \u00a332.6m move from Parma to Juve in 2001 .", "pos": [1286, 1390], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.023967266082763672}, {"sentence_idx": 11, "sentence": "Levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in Europe and will not let Lloris leave on someone else's terms.", "pos": [1391, 1507], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": 0.02053523063659668}, {"sentence_idx": 12, "sentence": "His reputation for getting maximum value from the club's assets was underlined when Real Madrid paid a world record \u00a385million for Gareth Bale after a summer of hardball tactics from Levy.", "pos": [1508, 1696], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": 0.019399404525756836}, {"sentence_idx": 13, "sentence": "And the Spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep Lloris, who signed a five-year deal last summer.", "pos": [1697, 1820], "label": [0, 0, 0], "perplexity": -0.010583877563476562}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris.

But what makes it so remarkable is the fact that Marcin accomplished his incredible feat without seeing what his hands were doing. Marcin Kowalczyk studies the Rubik's cube to memorise its pattern for the world record attempt . The speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the Rubik\u2019s cube and then, while blindfolded, he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in Szczecin in western Poland.

A judge holds a piece of paper between Marcin's face and his hands to make sure he can't see the cube .

John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the legislation includes a \"national security waiver\" that allows the president to transfer a suspect from military to civilian custody if he chooses. \"I want to clarify that my administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,\" Obama said in a statement Saturday. \"Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a nation.\" Obama said a section of the bill provides the \"executive branch\" with broad authority on military custody for non-citizen detainees. The legislators also agreed on tough sanctions language for the Iranian Central Bank, aimed at punishing Iran for its nuclear program. The measure \"will put real additional pressure on the Iranians so they are going to pay a bigger and bigger price, if they continue to move towards nuclear weapons,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In addition, legislators agreed to tough new restrictions on Pakistan to ensure that country is not participating in the manufacture and transport of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs -- the hidden bombs that have caused havoc for coalition forces in Afghanistan. \"Ultimately, I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes, but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety, security, and liberty of the American people,\" the president said Saturday.", "ref_summary": "Obama has concerns about flexibility of counterterrorism efforts .\nThe White House lifted a veto threat after changes in detainee language .\nThe issue involved presidential authority over military or civilian custody .\nThe $662 billion measure includes tough sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program .", "gen_summary": "The White House had lifted a veto threat against the bill.", "summary_idx": 0, "rel_sent_positions": [1, 3]}, {"id": "xsum__train__a64f9ec5ce0f4536ba00bcac3b092a5fcc6dc15c__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "train", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "a64f9ec5ce0f4536ba00bcac3b092a5fcc6dc15c", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "London (CNN)British prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb-making directions, in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret.", "pos": [0, 195], "label": [0, 1], "perplexity": 0.1432960033416748}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "The man, Erol Incedal, was found guilty last year of having details of how to make a bomb, but a jury failed to reach a decision on the more serious charge of plotting a terror attack.", "pos": [196, 380], "label": [1, 1], "perplexity": 6.536704063415527}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "A new jury was selected Tuesday, and prosecutor Richard Whittam began the state's second try.", "pos": [381, 474], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.06679117679595947}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Incedal was arrested in October 2013 and found to have the address of a property belonging to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Whittam told the jury.", "pos": [475, 646], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.052893996238708496}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "He also had the instructions for how to make a bomb on an SD card concealed between his phone and its case, Whittam said.", "pos": [647, 768], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.03451132774353027}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "Incedal does not need to have planned a specific attack or had a target in mind to be guilty of plotting terror, the prosecutor told the jury.", "pos": [769, 911], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.06406509876251221}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "The case is extremely unusual in that the media and public will be barred from hearing some of the evidence.", "pos": [912, 1020], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.009756326675415039}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "A select group of 10 journalists will be allowed to hear other parts of the trial, but must leave their notes in court.", "pos": [1021, 1140], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.009854316711425781}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "The rest of the trial is open to the public.", "pos": [1141, 1185], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": -0.0020592212677001953}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Incedal denies the charges.", "pos": [1186, 1213], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.02615213394165039}, {"sentence_idx": 10, "sentence": "The trial could last for several months.", "pos": [1214, 1254], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.022555828094482422}, {"sentence_idx": 11, "sentence": "London terror suspect recording: 'Terrorist' is a great word .", "pos": [1255, 1317], "label": [0, 0], "perplexity": 0.008207082748413086}], "summary_label": [1, 1], "document": "London (CNN)British prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb-making directions, in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret.
