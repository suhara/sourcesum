The play-off between Sweden and Portugal, who had both finished second in their qualifying groups, had been billed as a showdown between Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo - two of the best players in the world.
At the age of 32, Sweden skipper Zlatan Ibrahimovic may not have another opportunity to play in a World Cup finals.
And the tournament would represent a nadir in the Paris St-Germain striker's career. He has never scored at a finals having made two substitute appearances in 2002 and three starts in 2006.

Former Inter Milan forward Ibrahimovic, who has played in two World Cups, scored eight times in qualifying, including the play-offs, and assisted another six goals - having a hand in 14 out of Sweden's 21 goals.
He told Uefa's website: ""Why did we lose? To be honest, they were better than us. We should be proud. We couldn't have done better than we did.
""Of course, we could look back at our mistakes, but these things happen. They punished our mistakes. After making it 2-1 it felt like we were on a roll, our hopes grew, but unfortunately they made it 2-2 soon afterwards.""

The elaborate structure, dubbed a ""gynosome"", is used to suck out sperm and nutritious seminal fluids.
Copulation lasts an impressive 40-70 hours, the researchers report in Current Biology.
""Although sex-role reversal has been identified in several different animals, Neotrogla is the only example in which the intromittent organ is also reversed,"" said lead author Kazunori Yoshizawa from Hokkaido University in Japan.
The gender-bending insects were found in a cave in eastern Brazil and represent four distinct species in the Neotrogla genus.
Once inside a male, the membranous part of the female gynosome inflates. It has numerous spines which anchor the two insects together.
When the researchers attempted to pull a male and female apart, the male's abdomen was ripped from the thorax without breaking the genital coupling.
The unusual role reversal may have been driven by the resource-poor cave environment in which the bugs live, the researchers speculate.
Copulation provides a female with food as well as sperm - so it is advantageous for her to mate at a higher rate, they note.
The curious insects offer new opportunities to test ideas about sexual selection, conflict between the sexes, and the evolution of novelty.
""It will be important to unveil why, among many sex-role-reversed animals, only Neotrogla evolved the elaborated female penis,"" said Yoshitaka Kamimura from Keio University in Japan.

""The series of tests has proven the system and will help ensure crew and mission safety for our astronauts in the future.""

It will then be returned to Earth to test the performance of many of the craft's critical systems.
In the latest test, over the US Army's Yuma Proving Ground, engineers put additional stresses on the parachutes by allowing the test craft to ""free fall"" for 10 seconds, which increased the vehicle's speed and aerodynamic pressure.
After the free fall, Orion's parachutes deployed, pulling away the spacecraft's forward bay cover, which is critical to the rest of the system performing as required.

Mr Vaughan, who comes from Cwmbran, South Wales, is now an incomplete tetraplegic following the accident in 2009 and gave evidence from his wheelchair at London's High Court.
Mr Vaughan insisted he was ""on duty"" when he walked into the sea to ""cool off"", executing a shallow, surface dive as the waters reached waist height.

Tesco will retain an 8.3% holding in the South East Asia-focused business.
The move comes the day before Tesco's annual results, in which it is expected to announce further disposals.
The supermarket group is planning to sell off some of its side businesses, including Dobbies Garden Centres chain, coffee shop chain Harris & Hoole and restaurant chain Giraffe, so that it can focus on the main supermarket business, according to media reports.
Last September, Tesco sold its South Korean business, Homeplus, for £4.2bn to help shore up its balance sheet and revitalise its UK business.
There has been speculation about possible disposals since chief executive Dave Lewis took the helm in September 2014, charged with reviving the group's fortunes.
Mr Lewis was parachuted in after the supermarket reported it had overstated its profits by some £263m.
Alongside this, like its ""big four"" peers - Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons -  Tesco has been hit by competition from discount rivals Lidl and Aldi.
The UK has also seen a broad change in shopping habits, with many customers preferring to shop little and often at small convenience stores, instead of doing a once-a-week ""big shop"".
In April last year, the company reported a record pre-tax loss of £6.4bn for the year to February, marking the biggest loss reported to date by a British retailer.
Mr Lewis has focused on price cuts and putting more staff in stores in an attempt to revive sales.
On Wednesday, he is expected to report a rise in underlying fourth-quarter sales, the group's first quarterly increase for more than three years.

It is alleged the site has been pumping out more than double the legal amount of toxic nitrogen oxides for seven years.
The UK Government argues the power station is not in breach of the rules.
It further claims that the Vale of Glamorgan plant has made major investments to try to improve its performance.
In a document summarising his opinion of the case, advocate general of the European Court of Justice, Michal Bobek, says he finds the arguments put by the UK to be ""untenable"".
He proposes that the court find the UK to be in breach of its obligations under EU rules to limit pollution levels.
Director of Friends of the Earth Cymru, Gareth Clubb, said: ""Since at least 2001, Aberthaw power station has had no legal justification for emitting horrific amounts of toxic pollution into the atmosphere.
""The judgement spells disaster for Aberthaw. It's very difficult to see how it can avoid permanent closure once the Court of Justice reaches its final verdict.""
In April, BBC Wales revealed that Aberthaw's operator, RWE, is set to downgrade the plant so that it only generates electricity at times of peak demand.
The UK government has said it wants all coal-fired power stations to close by 2025.
RWE said it was ""disappointed"" with the advocate general's opinion but would await the final EU court judgement.
The UK government had claimed that an exemption in the law around air pollution for plants burning low volatile coal was aimed at sites such as Aberthaw, given that the anthracite coal it uses is sourced locally, harder to burn and important to the local economy.
""Aberthaw Power Station was specifically designed to burn Welsh, regional, low volatile coal and historically, 60% of its fuel diet is Welsh,"" a RWE spokesperson said, adding that ""the station has always been compliant with its operational permit.""

The carmaker said that there was ""no evidence"" that Autopilot was responsible.
It follows an investigation into a fatal accident in Florida where the focus is on the apparent failure of Tesla's technology.
In the incident in Pennsylvania, the Model X car hit a guard rail and veered into the eastbound lane, ending up on its roof.
In a statement, Tesla said: ""Based on the information we have now, we have no reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident.""
It said that it had received an automated alert from the car indicating airbags had been deployed but never received logs containing details about the state of vehicle controls, which would indicate whether Autopilot was on or off.
Autopilot is a feature which allows cars to automatically change lanes and react to traffic.
US car safety regulators are scrutinising the Pennsylvania crash to determine whether the Autopilot system was in use at the time.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a report last week following the death of 40-year-old Joshua Brown, who was killed while driving a Tesla in Florida.
It concluded that both the driver and the Autopilot system failed to detect a large tractor-trailer turning left in front of him.
In response to that, Tesla reiterated the safety record for its vehicles and the fact that the Autopilot feature is an auto-assist rather than autonomous feature - which means the driver needs to keep both hands on the wheel at all times.
The NHTSA is due to issue guidelines around the rules for autonomous car technology later this month.
Previously NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind has said that technology such as Autopilot needed to be twice as safe as the manual systems they replace.","The accident in Pennsylvania left the driver and his passenger injured.

The UAE government said the high-speed catamaran was carrying aid, wounded Yemenis and passengers when it was hit in the Bab al-Mandab strait.

However, a Houthi military spokesman told Saba that the charge was ""baseless and aimed to cover for the heinous Saudi crime of Saturday's air attacks on the civilian funeral hall in the capital Sanaa"", which killed more than 140 people.
A Saudi-led multinational coalition, whose air campaign against the Houthis and their allies is supported by the US, has denied any responsibility.
Also on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis at the King Fahd Air Base in Taif in central Saudi Arabia, which hosts US military personnel training the kingdom's armed forces.
A missile was also reportedly fired at the Yemeni government-controlled city of Marib in central Yemen.

There was a year-on-year decrease from about 19,800 cases in 2014, but the 2015 figure of 19,088 is likely to increase as statisticians revise the numbers.
Once age factors are taken into account, the rate decreased by more than 5% in men, but increased by more than 5% among women between 2006 and 2015.
