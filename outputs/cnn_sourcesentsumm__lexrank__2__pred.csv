Laura Cowan, 35, of Frederick, was charged last Wednesday with three counts of second degree rape. The same charges were filed against the former Tipton Public Schools educator last July, but in early December a judge threw out the case against Cowan after key witnesses could not be found by the prosecution. Bad teacher: Laura Cowan, 35, a former Oklahoma high school teacher and mother of one, has been charged with three counts of rape for allegedly having sex with two students . Cowan, who has a Master's degree in education from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, started her teaching career in 2010 at Davidson Public Schools. In 2012, she was hired by Tipton Public Schools, where she remained for two years until her resignation last April, reported NewsOK. Investigators say Cowan, the mother of a college-age daughter, admitted to repeatedly having sex with two of her students in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School. Law enforcement officials first learned of the rape allegations against Laura Cowan in April when Tipton Public Schools Superintendent Shane Boothe contacted police and the Tillman County Sheriff's Office about a possible 'inappropriate relationship' between the teacher and one of her students. Workplace tryst: The education allegedly admitted to repeatedly having sex with minors in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School . According to an affidavit prepared in July and obtained by the Frederick Press-Leader, during an interview with police Cowan described having sex with a student in her car during Spring Break 2014. The court document stated that the former teacher also admitted to sleeping with another teenager last January in a Frederick hotel and in her vehicle. She turned herself in to the sheriff's office July 23, 2014, and immediately posted $150,000 bond. During a preliminary hearing in December, key witnesses failed to show up in court to testify against Cowan, prompting the presiding judge to dismiss the case. However, prosecutors were given the option to refile the charges against the ex-teacher, which they chose to exercise last week.","Laura Cowan, 35, of Frederick, was charged last Wednesday with three counts of second degree rape.

The aid intended for up to 1.1 million people has been held up because local authorities blocked distribution of ICRC food and seed relief in the Middle Shabelle and Galgaduud regions in central and southern Somalia, according to a statement by the organization. ""We are actively seeking the cooperation of the local authorities to restore conditions that will allow the resumption of the suspended activities as soon as possible,"" said Patrick Vial, the head of the ICRC delegation for Somalia. According to the ICRC statement, the organization has distributed food relief to more than 1 million people and agricultural support to more than 100,000 farmers. In addition, the ICRC has helped treat more than 170,000 severely malnourished children and made health care more available in remote areas, the statement said. Last month, two attacks on aid workers in Somalia killed five people -- two from Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, and three from the U.N. World Food Programme. The African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, the capital, where Islamic militants had been especially active in their battle against that government. AMISOM forces reported in late December they had successfully pushed the Al-Shabaab movement out of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab is linked to al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist group by the United States.","The aid intended for up to 1.1 million people has been held up because local authorities blocked distribution of ICRC food and seed relief in the Middle Shabelle and Galgaduud regions in central and southern Somalia, according to a statement by the organization.

'We had a training session yesterday with two groups where we were making changes and he was fine,' Simeone told a news conference on Tuesday. 'We now have another training session where we expect him to be okay and I will base my plan, which I have fairly clearly in mind, around that.' Mandzukic is favourite, ahead of Fernando Torres, to play in attack alongside Antoine Griezmann who took his time to settle in at Atletico but is now in a rich vein of form. 'He has developed a lot since he arrived and the goals that he has scored in La Liga show that,' said Simeone. France international Griezmann hit both goals against Deportivo and has 20 in La Liga. 'He has adapted to a new position very well and is starting to show his potential. He is still young and he can improve but he is on the right lines to do that,' added Simeone.

A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.","Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man .

According to the Daily Telegraph he told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme: 'We used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated. 'People are checking their emails all the time, you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be.'

Passion killed: People are check their emails 'all the time', according to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University (file picture) But he added: 'A more realistic explanation is that as we’ve become better connected technologically, our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home, work and the outside world. This has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves. The statistician quotes Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, as saying: ‘With an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.’ She adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that ‘come bedtime, we’re just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner.’","Smartphone use may be to blame for a drop in the number of times couples are having sex each month, a leading expert has suggested.

The duo has also worked with Natalia Rak, another young Polish artist who has produced her own larger-than-life pieces in Poland and the United States. Most of the recent projects by Rak and Etam have been commissioned by local city festivals, which have given the artists permission to paint without worry about being caught or prosecuted. From a tumbling jockey to a fantasy tree house, the artists employ a mix of modern styles and motifs from traditional Polish folklore. Each piece takes around a week to produce, says Blejzyk, and the reaction from the public is usually positive. ""For us most the important thing is to create an illustration where people could stop in front of it and turn on their imagination for a couple of minutes,"" he says.","In cities across the country artists have transformed the sides of houses and apartment blocks with enormous murals, some pieces stretching upwards of ten stories.

The Vietnam War had ended for the United States the year prior, but the emotional and psychological toll at home had just begun. The lifting of the 1973 oil embargo in March 1974 eased economic tensions and allowed Americans to hit the open roads once again. And, let's not forget the Watergate scandal. By the summer of 1974, the fate of most of the president's men had been decided, and the Supreme Court had rejected President Richard Nixon's claims of executive privilege, paving the way for his resignation August 9. It was a time of weariness and confusion, which was reflected in the music and films of 1974. But it also was a period of transition for America as the progressive values that emerged in the 1960s around political awareness and women's rights continued to flourish.

Sean O'Neil, an Australian 43-year-old computer programmer, was found guilty of multiple rape and of corrupting minors by a closed-door appeals court in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence on Monday. O'Neil forced a total of four teenage girls to live as naked slaves in his French Riviera apartment in the town of Valbonne, where he subjected them to pornographic photo sessions and made them recite the Hare Krishna mantra 1,700 times a day. Sean O'Neil, an Australian 43-year-old computer programmer, was sentenced to 19 years in jail after being found guilty of multiple rape and of corrupting minors on Monday . The three girls he regularly raped between 2009 and 2010 while they were aged around 15 and made psychologically dependent on the Australian. The court rejected O'Neil's argument that the sex was consensual to confirm a lower court's October 2013 conviction, and to lengthen an original sentence of 15 years in prison. It also barred him from re-entering France once he had served his time. O'Neil forced a total of four teenage girls to live as naked slaves in his French Riviera apartment in the town of Valbonne, where he subjected them to pornographic photo sessions . One expert testified that the girls cooperated because they were in a trance-like state approaching 'hypnosis'. The victims described O'Neil as a 'guru' who urged them to recruit other young virgins of the same age with the aim of starting a commune in Australia. The crimes came to light in 2010 after one of the girls described what they were enduring to a school employee.","Sean O'Neil, an Australian 43-year-old computer programmer, was found guilty of multiple rape and of corrupting minors by a closed-door appeals court in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence on Monday.

An asteroid (inside circle) passed within 38,000 miles of Earth on Monday. Asteroid 2009 DD45 on Monday passed within 38,000 miles of Earth, less than twice the height of the geostationary satellites we depend on for communications, according to Robert McNaught of the Australian National University. McNaught, who watches for asteroids with his telescope 250 miles northwest of Sydney, Australia, discovered the approaching rock last week. ""It's not something to worry about, but something to be aware of,"" he said. While a direct hit on Earth could be a devastating natural disaster, McNaught said keeping track of asteroids can make a hit ""potentially preventable."" ""If discovered in advance and with enough lead time, there is the possibility of pushing it off course, if you have decades of advance warning,"" McNaught said. ""If you have only a few days, you can evacuate the area of impact, but there's not a great deal [else] you can do."" In either case, he said, a global catastrophe as depicted in Hollywood movies such as ""Deep Impact"" is ""very, very unlikely."" The 2009 DD45 asteroid circles the sun every 18 months, but its path will not threaten this planet at least for the next century, he said. The number of ""potentially harmful asteroids"" discovered each year has grown dramatically over the past decade as ""systematic programs"" to scan the skies have been put in place, McNaught said. Nearly 100 new ones have been found in each of the past several years, he said.","You had a close encounter with a 40-yard-wide asteroid this week, but the astronomer who first spotted the large rock said it's nothing to worry about.

The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. ""Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,"" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. But when police interviewed the woman again in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough, she discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest in Seattle in early July. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph's death. Maria's brother, Charles Ridulph, appeared at a news conference with Campbell and said the family had agreed to the exhumation. ""Although the events were very difficult and very unsettling, we understand the necessity for these things, and we are in complete agreement and thankful for the way this case is being handled,"" he said.","Investigators Wednesday exhumed the body of a 7-year-old Illinois girl slain more than five decades ago in hopes that modern science will bolster the case against the man now accused of killing her.

It was the latest incident in a string of rescues since the beginning of the year, against a backdrop of high tensions between the United States and Iran. The coastal patrol boat USS Firebolt and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui conducted a search and rescue mission for survivors of the capsized Iranian dhow -- a sailing vessel typically used to haul cargo -- on Saturday and Sunday, the Navy said in a statement. The Firebolt's crew also recovered the remains of three of those who had died in the sinking, the Navy said. One survivor was recovered and treated for shock and hypothermia. He said the dhow sank in bad weather Friday night with six mariners aboard. The sailor reported that four of his shipmates died and one was missing, according to the Navy. The U.S. ships searched for the possible survivor and the fourth body, in an effort that also included two Seahawk helicopters and the dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor. But they could not find them, and ultimately ended the search due to bad weather, the Navy said. The Iranian mariner was transferred to the Maui, and then to an Iranian Coast Guard vessel. In January, U.S. sailors from a carrier strike group rescued 13 Iranian sailors from a hijacked fishing boat, and the U.S. Coast Guard rescued six Iranian mariners from a flooded vessel at the northern end of the Gulf.","The U.S. Navy rescued a survivor from an Iranian cargo vessel that sank in the Persian Gulf, killing at least three other crew members, the military said Sunday.

Goolsbee has been an outspoken defender of Obama's policies as the U.S. economy struggles to find its footing following the steep recession of 2007-09. In a statement announcing Goolsbee's departure, Obama called him ""a close friend"" and ""one of America's great economic thinkers."" ""Over the past several years, he has helped steer our country out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,"" Obama said. ""And although there is still much work ahead, his insights and counsel have helped lead us toward an economy that is growing and creating millions of jobs."" The announcement came after a series of reports that showed the U.S. economy struggling to maintain headway after the housing bust, banking crisis and recession. Sunday, Goolsbee told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that despite disappointing employment, manufacturing and housing price figures, the long-term trends remain positive. Goolsbee taught at the University of Chicago for 14 years before joining the administration and will return to the school in time for the fall semester, the White House said.

""There's no question as you come out of the worst downturn in most of our lifetimes, that it is going to be fragile,"" Goolsbee said.

Young, who did not testify in his own defense, is charged with complicity to murder for his alleged role in the slaying of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011. Prosecutors say the 17-year-old acted in concert with his father, Josh Gouker, to kill Zwicker, 14. Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's defense attorneys argue that Gouker acted alone in killing Zwicker. Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him ""very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed."" The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions. ""They were sitting together on the couch, playing video games. Very relaxed, kind of joking with each other,"" said Allison Miller about a 2011 visit she made to the home. Miller told prosecutors during her short cross-examination that she witnessed the pair interacting for only about a minute before Gouker told them to leave the room. The judge told jurors he expected them to get the case around lunchtime Friday, after attorneys present their closing arguments. The judge also told jurors to pack an overnight bag in case they don't reach a verdict Friday night, in which case they would be sequestered and continue to deliberate on Saturday.","It took less than an hour for Joshua Young's defense team to call four additional witnesses, including his aunt and social worker, before resting its case Thursday.

It's a growing problem in the United States, but fighting it doesn't appear to be a priority, a new report says. A report by the Justice Department Inspector General released Tuesday cites the wide-ranging costs and dangers of ID theft. Although the report has no new numbers, the financial losses are believed to be substantially higher than the $15.6 billion documented in 2005. Inspector General Glenn Fine found the effort to combat the problem, however, has lagged since the President's Task Force on ID Theft was established in 2007. ""We found that to some degree identity theft initiatives have faded as priorities,"" said Fine. He said the Justice Department has not developed a coordinated plan to combat ID theft and that some recommendations of the President's Task Force have not been addressed. No one has been appointed to oversee the efforts, the report says. The report says ""the specific crime of identity theft is not a top FBI priority."" However, the report adds that the FBI often addresses the issue through the Cyber Division's criminal intrusion program, which is a priority of the agency. Similarly, ID theft investigations are often part of larger federal criminal investigations into health care fraud, mortgage fraud and credit card fraud. ""Identity theft can also be a significant element of violent crimes, such as domestic abuse, and even terrorism, and a significant number of ID theft-related crimes originate overseas,"" the report said.","Washington (CNN)  -- Ten million Americans a year are victims of identity theft.

But these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers. As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips. These days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers (file image) Almost 40 per cent of people, including 66 per cent of those aged 18-29, spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it, according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer Alfresia.co.uk. Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: ‘British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. ‘Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.’ Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: ‘The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.’ As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden – and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth £1,928. And around 57 per cent of householders surveyed by Lloyds TSB said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.","But these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers.

Specifically, he referenced a bounty set for the death of U.S. Ambassador to Yemen, Gerald Feierstein. ""These prizes have a great effect in instilling fear in the hearts of our cowardly enemies,"" Gadahn who has a $1 million dollar bounty on his head, says in the video.

Multiple American embassies across North Africa and the Middle East were closed earlier this month in light of intelligence information suggesting a possible attack. All have reopened. But an administration official, asked whether the closures were linked to the Gadahn video, told CNN that while al Qaeda's general intentions were a factor in the closures, ""this video was not specifically a factor.""

Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself.

However, one of Jamaica's most decorated athletes must now wait to see if the IAAF, track and field's world governing body, agrees with the recommendation made by the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA). If it does, it would provide welcome relief for Jamaica's sprinting community -- Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July. Garth Gayle, general secretary of the JAAA, confirmed to CNN Thursday that it recommended Campbell-Brown receive a warning following her positive test for a banned diuretic in May. She was provisionally suspended. Gayle didn't reveal further details but the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported that the JAAA's disciplinary panel ruled the 31-year-old didn't use the substance to enhance performance. The IAAF's doping review board is expected to make a decision in the case in two or three weeks, an IAAF spokesman told CNN.

An 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board an Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto that forced a diversion to Shannon Airport . On touching down at around 8.15pm local time, Gardaí­ and airport police officers were standing by, and the woman was taken into custody. MailOnline Travel have been advised by Irish police that the woman has since been released without charge, and she will be undergoing a 'fit-to-fly- screening in the hope of continuing her journey. There is no indication from the police as to the actions of the woman on board at this time. The decision was taken to divert when the Air Canada flight ACA-877 was around 600 miles north west of Shannon, and the plane, carrying 211 passengers, turned around. The Irish Times report that 'airport emergency services were standing by at strategic locations along the runway so that they could follow the aircraft once it had landed.' On touching down at Shannon Airport, the elderly woman was met by Irish police and taken into custody . As expected with unscheduled landings, the plane was forced to dump fuel in advance of the descent over the Atlantic. A spokesperson for Air Canada told MailOnline Travel: 'Our flight, AC877 on Friday, April 10, Frankfurt to Toronto, diverted to Shannon due to a disruptive passenger, who was removed from the aircraft. 'It was a B777 with 211 passengers. It subsequently departed and completed its journey.'","On touching down at around 8.15pm local time, Gardaí­ and airport police officers were standing by, and the woman was taken into custody.

xsum__train__a5c677fca2463c1d8db87d7db296c32cbbfea133__reference__0,lexrank,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Saturday reluctantly signed a defense authorization bill, saying he was concerned about some in Congress who want to restrict options used by counterterrorism officials. ""I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists,"" he said of the $662 billion legislation. The White House had lifted a veto threat against the bill after legislators made changes in language involving detainees. In particular, the legislators added language to make clear that nothing in the bill requiring military custody of al Qaeda suspects would interfere with the ability of civilian law enforcement to carry out terrorism investigations and interrogations in the United States. The House approved the bill on December 14, and a 86-13 vote in the Senate the next day completed the necessary congressional action. At issue was the president's authority in deciding whether people detained in terrorism investigations would be held in military or civilian custody. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the legislation includes a ""national security waiver"" that allows the president to transfer a suspect from military to civilian custody if he chooses. ""I want to clarify that my administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,"" Obama said in a statement Saturday. ""Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a nation."" Obama said a section of the bill provides the ""executive branch"" with broad authority on military custody for non-citizen detainees. The legislators also agreed on tough sanctions language for the Iranian Central Bank, aimed at punishing Iran for its nuclear program. The measure ""will put real additional pressure on the Iranians so they are going to pay a bigger and bigger price, if they continue to move towards nuclear weapons,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In addition, legislators agreed to tough new restrictions on Pakistan to ensure that country is not participating in the manufacture and transport of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs -- the hidden bombs that have caused havoc for coalition forces in Afghanistan. ""Ultimately, I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes, but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety, security, and liberty of the American people,"" the president said Saturday.","Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Saturday reluctantly signed a defense authorization bill, saying he was concerned about some in Congress who want to restrict options used by counterterrorism officials.

The man, Erol Incedal, was found guilty last year of having details of how to make a bomb, but a jury failed to reach a decision on the more serious charge of plotting a terror attack. A new jury was selected Tuesday, and prosecutor Richard Whittam began the state's second try. Incedal was arrested in October 2013 and found to have the address of a property belonging to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Whittam told the jury. He also had the instructions for how to make a bomb on an SD card concealed between his phone and its case, Whittam said. Incedal does not need to have planned a specific attack or had a target in mind to be guilty of plotting terror, the prosecutor told the jury. The case is extremely unusual in that the media and public will be barred from hearing some of the evidence. A select group of 10 journalists will be allowed to hear other parts of the trial, but must leave their notes in court. The rest of the trial is open to the public. Incedal denies the charges.

""In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian,"" Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday. He took a more confident stance Saturday, announcing that under his presidency, all petrol refineries are now working, the banking sector has been reformed, electricity has been stablized and steps have been taken to fix roads, water, education and food production. He also said he has set in progress free and fair elections. Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the People's Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north. Yar'Adua's death in May, after a long illness, upset the order of the zoning. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power.

Victor Manuel Solis, 53, was arrested in Lancaster, California, in connection with the ongoing search for Henry Solis, a rookie officer with the L.A. police who is believed to have entered Mexico from El Paso, Texas, the FBI said. An FBI complaint said a video recording at the border crossing showed father and son entering Mexico together at 5:40 a.m. March 14, even though the elder Solis told an agent he dropped his son at an El Paso bus station and didn't know where he went. Victor Solis ""knowingly and willingly lied during the interview in order to thwart law enforcement investigative efforts,"" the complaint said. Henry Solis is accused of killing Salome Rodriguez Jr. early in the morning of March 13 in Pomona, California. Items left by Solis at the crime scene allowed Pomona police detectives to identify him ""as the individual responsible for killing Rodriguez,"" according to an FBI affidavit.

David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. ""Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,"" Earnest said. ""He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice."" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession.

When he was questioned by the FBI at the time, he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to court documents.

Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has extended his plus one to Samantha Garvey, a 17-year-old homeless science superstar from Brentwood, New York. Garvey was told last week at the shelter her family had been staying in that her study on the ribbed sea mussels of Long Island's salt marshes had earned her semifinalist recognition in Intel's science talent search and a potential $100,000 scholarship. Two days later, after county officials heard Garvey's story, they announced that a three-bedroom home in Bellmore would be rented for the Garvey family as part of Suffolk County's affordable housing program. The Garveys were living in a shelter after being kicked out of their home on New Year's Eve. Israel called Garvey ""an inspiration,"" and said he thought her presence would be an important influence on attendees of President Barack Obama's address on January 24. ""The same people that will praise Samantha with one hand might be the same people that will slash budgets for science and education on the other,"" Israel said. Her story, he said, was one of staying steadfast in the face of adversity. Israel said he had plans for himself and Garvey to meet with multiple White House officials before the speech.

Last week, during the national costume part of the competition, Miss Peru, Karen Schwarz, wore an Andean-inspired outfit featuring a headpiece with large horns based on the costume used in the traditional Diablada, or deviled, folk dance. In wearing the outfit, Schwarz unwittingly set off a firestorm in Bolivia, whose culture minister Pablo Groux threatened to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to claim that the Diablada belongs to Bolivia's culture and no one else. Bolivia sent a letter to the Miss Universe organizers, citing evidence that the dance has its roots in Bolivia and distinctly belongs to the country, Bolivia's state-run news agency ABI reported. Bolivia dancers showcased the Diablada at events in Washington and Panama, and Bolivia's ambassador to France summed up the country's stance, according to ABI: ""We ask that urgent, adequate, opportune and pertinent measures be taken to protect Bolivian cultural patrimony and the respect of the origin of our customs and ancient traditions."" Peruvian officials have said that the Diablada folk dance has its roots in both countries. Bolivia has no grounds to claim the dance in the international court, countered Peru's director of its National Institute of Culture, Cecilia Bakula told the newspaper El Comercio. ""This issue should stop because we can't lose tolerance or respect between both countries over things like this,"" Schwarz said in an interview with Bolivian media. ""We have a dance that unites us because the Diablada is danced in Bolivia and Peru."" The cultural dispute comes at a time of political disagreement between the countries relating to maritime access at the border between Chile and Peru.

Tilikum made his return appearance Wednesday morning in front of an audience in the ""Believe"" show. Trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed on February 24, 2010, when the killer whale -- commonly known as an orca -- grabbed her ponytail and pulled her under the water in front of horrified visitors. Brancheau died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,"" the Orange County Sheriff's office said at the time of the accident. Anthony Frogameni, Brancheau's nephew, said the family did not want to comment on Tilikum's return. ""From the start we've decided, it's a large family we all have our different opinions but we're just not going to talk about that aspect of it -- we're only going to focus on Dawn, "" Frogameni said. The Dawn Brancheau Foundation, which her family founded in her memory, says that the 40-year-old trainer's hair was especially long the day she was killed because she was growing it out to donate it to Locks of Love. The nonprofit organization provides hairpieces to disadvantaged children dealing with long-term hair loss due to medical treatment. SeaWorld had not answered written questions from CNN as of Wednesday evening, but did issue a statement saying Tilikum's participation in the shows was ""an important component of his physical, social and mental enrichment."" Since the accident last year, trainers no longer go into the water with any of the orcas at SeaWorld parks. In August, SeaWorld was fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one in connection with Brancheau's death.

The digital-age legislation appears to be the first of its kind. It addresses so-called ""disparagement clauses,"" lines included in businesses' terms of service that prohibit customers from posting negative comments about the service they received. The new law bans such clauses. It would fine any business that tries to enforce one $2,500 the first time and $5,000 every time after that, with another $10,000 added if the action is considered ""willful, intentional or reckless.""

Last month, Union Street Guest House in Hudson, New York, was featured in the New York Post for trying to fine wedding parties $500 for each negative online review by a member of their parties. Hundreds of people took to Yelp to complain about the policy and write mostly fake, eviscerating reviews of the hotel.

The ""new Shirley,"" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster's Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie.

Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta's parents.

His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran. Tehran agreed to halt the country's nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran's economy. Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn't ""have the luxury of testing these propositions"" in the deal. ""But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them,"" Obama said. That, he said, should be ""sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table,"" he said.

The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30. But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran won't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country's leadership isn't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are. Obama said even if Iran can't be trusted, there's still a case to be made for the deal. ""In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they're doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said.","His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran.

Two army explosives experts, a general and a colonel, and five members of the Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis were killed in the shootout in Qalyubia province, north of Cairo, the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. Four other members of the group, one of Egypt's most active militant organizations, were wounded, as was a special forces officer. Intelligence had indicated the group was using a wood manufacturing workshop as a base and to store weapons and ammunition, the Interior Ministry said. The clashes lasted several hours, the statement added. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been blamed for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula as well as on a security forces headquarters in the town of Mansoura last year. It claimed responsibility in January for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around Cairo. Islamist militants are expanding their insurgency in Egypt, where army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to announce he will run for president. El-Sisi played a key role in the military overthrow of former President Mohamed Morsy last July. Militants based in the Sinai Peninsula near the Israeli border have stepped up attacks on soldiers and policemen since Morsy's ouster, which came amid widespread protests against his rule. Morsy and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after.

De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around £10million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday. Sport say 'Messi is OK', with the news that 'all tests were positive' on his injured foot, and Marca add that the Barca star has 'overcome the pain'. Lionel Messi's injury dominates in Sport, while in Italy there is more news on Palermo's Paulo Dybala . However, the Madrid-based paper also report that 'he still can’t put his boot on' because of the injury to his metatarsal. There is better news for James Rodriguez, who is also set to return from injury, with Marca reporting that he will start for Real Madrid on Sunday, his first game for 59 days. In Italy there are reports that Palermo striker Paulo Dybala, who has been linked with Arsenal, could join up with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan.

A final outcome to what has been monthslong series of negotiations is expected to have a lasting effect on Iran's relations with the West. Speaking to Iran's IRNA news agency, Araqchi said the talks will be at the deputy ministerial level, followed by a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zari and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are scheduled to join the talks in Geneva on Sunday and Monday, Araqchi said. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S. side. ""At the end of the four days of bilateral talks between Iranian and US nuclear delegations, discussions will possibly continue with participation of all members of the Group 5+1,"" Araqchi said. Better known as the P5+1, that group consists of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France. The plus one is Germany. A comprehensive agreement could bring about an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and a warming of relations with the West. The absence of a deal would most likely ramp up tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- and even confrontation -- over Iran's controversial nuclear program.
