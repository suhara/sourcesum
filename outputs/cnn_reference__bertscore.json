Laura Cowan, 35, of Frederick, was charged last Wednesday with three counts of second degree rape. The same charges were filed against the former Tipton Public Schools educator last July, but in early December a judge threw out the case against Cowan after key witnesses could not be found by the prosecution. Bad teacher: Laura Cowan, 35, a former Oklahoma high school teacher and mother of one, has been charged with three counts of rape for allegedly having sex with two students . Cowan, who has a Master's degree in education from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, started her teaching career in 2010 at Davidson Public Schools. In 2012, she was hired by Tipton Public Schools, where she remained for two years until her resignation last April, reported NewsOK. Investigators say Cowan, the mother of a college-age daughter, admitted to repeatedly having sex with two of her students in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School. Law enforcement officials first learned of the rape allegations against Laura Cowan in April when Tipton Public Schools Superintendent Shane Boothe contacted police and the Tillman County Sheriff's Office about a possible 'inappropriate relationship' between the teacher and one of her students. Workplace tryst: The education allegedly admitted to repeatedly having sex with minors in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School . According to an affidavit prepared in July and obtained by the Frederick Press-Leader, during an interview with police Cowan described having sex with a student in her car during Spring Break 2014. The court document stated that the former teacher also admitted to sleeping with another teenager last January in a Frederick hotel and in her vehicle.

The 43-year-old German is the second driver in F1 history, after Brazil's Rubens Barrichello, to achieve the feat and will be hoping for an upturn in his fortunes in his Mercedes. A superb podium finish at the European Grand Prix has been mixed with retirements in six of 10 races this season and Schumacher is confident he can turn it around on his favorite circuit. \"Spa is like my living room; for me, it's clearly the number one race track in the world,\" Schumacher told the official F1 website. \"It's uncanny how I always seem to have special moments there -- my debut, my first win, a world championship victory and many great races. \"We delivered a good performance in Spa last year; I'll be doing everything possible to drive a strong race,\" he added. Schumacher's first appearance in F1 came at Spa in 1991 for Jordan before he moved to Benetton to win successive titles in 1994 and 1995. He switched to Ferrari the next year and won five further titles with the famous marque before retiring in 2006.

Police feared she may have been driven to London by an older man when they launched an appeal for information this morning. The schoolgirl had not been seen since 11.30pm on Friday night. Sussex Police said she may have been talking with someone on FaceTime before disappearing at around 2am. The force launched a public appeal for information on her whereabouts on Saturday morning. In it, she was described as fair with long, blonde hair and as having possibly been wearing black riding trousers and a polo shirt or a Paisley pattern dress. On Saturday afternoon the force confirmed she had been found safe and well in Croydon but could not confirm the circumstances under which police located her. No one has been arrested in connection with her disappearance. Shortly after 4pm a spokesman said: 'Jasmine Coleman, the 12-year-old girl from Lancing reported missing from home during the early hours of Saturday (21 March) was found safe and well later the same day in Croydon.

The Vietnam War had ended for the United States the year prior, but the emotional and psychological toll at home had just begun. The lifting of the 1973 oil embargo in March 1974 eased economic tensions and allowed Americans to hit the open roads once again. And, let's not forget the Watergate scandal. By the summer of 1974, the fate of most of the president's men had been decided, and the Supreme Court had rejected President Richard Nixon's claims of executive privilege, paving the way for his resignation August 9. It was a time of weariness and confusion, which was reflected in the music and films of 1974. But it also was a period of transition for America as the progressive values that emerged in the 1960s around political awareness and women's rights continued to flourish.

A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike. When Paul Gregory, 51, applied to renew his blue badge, he claimed exercise left him breathless, despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club. He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette,  describing how the 'experienced walker' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012. The article, which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear, told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria. The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application. Gregory, of Bedford, pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates' Court. He was fined \u00a3795, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a\u00a0\u00a360 victim surcharge. He was also subject to a one year supervision order and told to undergo 19 sessions of 'thinking skills'. A\u00a0Bedford Borough Council spokesman said it was one of the 'most outrageous cases' of blue badge fraud it had investigated.

While a direct hit on Earth could be a devastating natural disaster, McNaught said keeping track of asteroids can make a hit \"potentially preventable.\" \"If discovered in advance and with enough lead time, there is the possibility of pushing it off course, if you have decades of advance warning,\" McNaught said. \"If you have only a few days, you can evacuate the area of impact, but there's not a great deal [else] you can do.\" In either case, he said, a global catastrophe as depicted in Hollywood movies such as \"Deep Impact\" is \"very, very unlikely.\" The 2009 DD45 asteroid circles the sun every 18 months, but its path will not threaten this planet at least for the next century, he said. The number of \"potentially harmful asteroids\" discovered each year has grown dramatically over the past decade as \"systematic programs\" to scan the skies have been put in place, McNaught said. Nearly 100 new ones have been found in each of the past several years, he said.", "ref_summary": "Asteroid passes within 38,000 miles of Earth on Monday, an astronomer says .\nThe 40-yard-wide rock was nothing to be worried about, he says .\nAsteroid was spotted by Robert McNaught through his telescope in rural Australia .", "gen_summary": "Asteroid was spotted by Robert McNaught through his telescope in rural Australia .", "summary_idx": 2, "rel_sent_positions": [4, 5]}, {"id": "xsum__validation__7abf4ca737f793517c53220f375c10ef6e5a51a7__reference__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "validation", "model": "reference", "original_id": "7abf4ca737f793517c53220f375c10ef6e5a51a7", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Manchester City\u00a0have signed teenage Watford forward Jadon Sancho in a \u00a3500,000 deal.", "pos": [0, 84], "label": [1, 1, 1], "bertscore": 0.9285047650337219}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "The Championship club agreed terms on Friday and the 14-year-old will link up with City's academy.", "pos": [85, 183], "label": [0, 0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8553740978240967}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "Sancho, an England Under 15 international, already has a sponsorship deal with Nike and is tipped to make a top flight career.", "pos": [184, 310], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8472093343734741}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City have recruited youngster Jadon Sancho from Watford .", "pos": [311, 399], "label": [0, 0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8867746591567993}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Sergio Aguero (right) pictured in action in City's last Premier League game, a 2-0 win over Leicester City .", "pos": [400, 508], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8460630178451538}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "James Milner (right) scored the second goal for City in the 88th minute of the game against Leicester .", "pos": [509, 612], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8592812418937683}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "City will pay an initial \u00a366,000 with the fee increasing on appearances and Watford have also secured a 10percent sell-on.", "pos": [613, 735], "label": [1, 1, 1], "bertscore": 0.8765528798103333}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "Liverpool had also shown an interest in the youngster.", "pos": [736, 790], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8574904799461365}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "City's next game in the Premier League is against Burnley at Turf Moor on March 14.", "pos": [791, 874], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8341442346572876}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Manchester City\u00a0have signed teenage Watford forward Jadon Sancho in a \u00a3500,000 deal.

Young, who did not testify in his own defense, is charged with complicity to murder for his alleged role in the slaying of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011. Prosecutors say the 17-year-old acted in concert with his father, Josh Gouker, to kill Zwicker, 14. Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's defense attorneys argue that Gouker acted alone in killing Zwicker. Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him \"very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed.\" The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions. \"They were sitting together on the couch, playing video games. Very relaxed, kind of joking with each other,\" said Allison Miller about a 2011 visit she made to the home.

Although the report has no new numbers, the financial losses are believed to be substantially higher than the $15.6 billion documented in 2005. Inspector General Glenn Fine found the effort to combat the problem, however, has lagged since the President's Task Force on ID Theft was established in 2007. \"We found that to some degree identity theft initiatives have faded as priorities,\" said Fine. He said the Justice Department has not developed a coordinated plan to combat ID theft and that some recommendations of the President's Task Force have not been addressed.

The House approved the bill on December 14, and a 86-13 vote in the Senate the next day completed the necessary congressional action. At issue was the president's authority in deciding whether people detained in terrorism investigations would be held in military or civilian custody. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the legislation includes a \"national security waiver\" that allows the president to transfer a suspect from military to civilian custody if he chooses. \"I want to clarify that my administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,\" Obama said in a statement Saturday. \"Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a nation.\" Obama said a section of the bill provides the \"executive branch\" with broad authority on military custody for non-citizen detainees. The legislators also agreed on tough sanctions language for the Iranian Central Bank, aimed at punishing Iran for its nuclear program. The measure \"will put real additional pressure on the Iranians so they are going to pay a bigger and bigger price, if they continue to move towards nuclear weapons,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In addition, legislators agreed to tough new restrictions on Pakistan to ensure that country is not participating in the manufacture and transport of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs -- the hidden bombs that have caused havoc for coalition forces in Afghanistan. \"Ultimately, I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes, but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety, security, and liberty of the American people,\" the president said Saturday.", "ref_summary": "Obama has concerns about flexibility of counterterrorism efforts .\nThe White House lifted a veto threat after changes in detainee language .\nThe issue involved presidential authority over military or civilian custody .\nThe $662 billion measure includes tough sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program .", "gen_summary": "The $662 billion measure includes tough sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program .", "summary_idx": 3, "rel_sent_positions": [11, 12]}, {"id": "xsum__train__a64f9ec5ce0f4536ba00bcac3b092a5fcc6dc15c__reference__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "train", "model": "reference", "original_id": "a64f9ec5ce0f4536ba00bcac3b092a5fcc6dc15c", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "London (CNN)British prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb-making directions, in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret.", "pos": [0, 195], "label": [1, 1], "bertscore": 0.8605242967605591}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "The man, Erol Incedal, was found guilty last year of having details of how to make a bomb, but a jury failed to reach a decision on the more serious charge of plotting a terror attack.", "pos": [196, 380], "label": [1, 1], "bertscore": 0.91949063539505}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "A new jury was selected Tuesday, and prosecutor Richard Whittam began the state's second try.", "pos": [381, 474], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8467827439308167}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Incedal was arrested in October 2013 and found to have the address of a property belonging to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Whittam told the jury.", "pos": [475, 646], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8651591539382935}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "He also had the instructions for how to make a bomb on an SD card concealed between his phone and its case, Whittam said.", "pos": [647, 768], "label": [0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8606356382369995}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "Incedal does not need to have planned a specific attack or had a target in mind to be guilty of plotting terror, the prosecutor told the jury.", "pos": [769, 911], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8760517835617065}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "The case is extremely unusual in that the media and public will be barred from hearing some of the evidence.", "pos": [912, 1020], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.853989839553833}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "A select group of 10 journalists will be allowed to hear other parts of the trial, but must leave their notes in court.", "pos": [1021, 1140], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8492023944854736}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "The rest of the trial is open to the public.", "pos": [1141, 1185], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8672372102737427}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Incedal denies the charges.", "pos": [1186, 1213], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8956246376037598}, {"sentence_idx": 10, "sentence": "The trial could last for several months.", "pos": [1214, 1254], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8533226251602173}, {"sentence_idx": 11, "sentence": "London terror suspect recording: 'Terrorist' is a great word .", "pos": [1255, 1317], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.839767575263977}], "summary_label": [1, 1], "document": "London (CNN)British prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb-making directions, in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret.

Jonathan's official declaration comes three days after he informally announced on Facebook that he intended to run in the primaries, which will be held between October 18 and 20, according PDP spokesman Rufai Alkali. \"In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian,\" Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday. He took a more confident stance Saturday, announcing that under his presidency, all petrol refineries are now working, the banking sector has been reformed, electricity has been stablized and steps have been taken to fix roads, water, education and food production. He also said he has set in progress free and fair elections. Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the People's Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian \"zoning\" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north.

David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. \"Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,\" Earnest said. \"He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.\" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013.

David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. \"Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,\" Earnest said. \"He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.\" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013. When he was questioned by the FBI at the time, he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to court documents.

Trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed on February 24, 2010, when the killer whale -- commonly known as an orca -- grabbed her ponytail and pulled her under the water in front of horrified visitors. Brancheau died from \"multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,\" the Orange County Sheriff's office said at the time of the accident. Anthony Frogameni, Brancheau's nephew, said the family did not want to comment on Tilikum's return. \"From the start we've decided, it's a large family we all have our different opinions but we're just not going to talk about that aspect of it -- we're only going to focus on Dawn, \" Frogameni said.

The nonprofit organization provides hairpieces to disadvantaged children dealing with long-term hair loss due to medical treatment.

Most people from outside the UK will continue to have to buy tickets through authorized resellers in each country ahead of the Olympics' opening ceremony on July 27. For those who want to experience to the Olympic Park without Games tickets, they will soon be able to buy access to the grounds for \u00c2\u00a310 ($16).

Two army explosives experts, a general and a colonel, and five members of the Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis were killed in the shootout in Qalyubia province, north of Cairo, the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. Four other members of the group, one of Egypt's most active militant organizations, were wounded, as was a special forces officer. Intelligence had indicated the group was using a wood manufacturing workshop as a base and to store weapons and ammunition, the Interior Ministry said. The clashes lasted several hours, the statement added. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been blamed for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula as well as on a security forces headquarters in the town of Mansoura last year. It claimed responsibility in January for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around Cairo. Islamist militants are expanding their insurgency in Egypt, where army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to announce he will run for president. El-Sisi played a key role in the military overthrow of former President Mohamed Morsy last July.
