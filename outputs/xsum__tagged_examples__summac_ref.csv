16228680,"Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river.
He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing.
The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists.
Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing.
He had barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals.
Legal wrangling
Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work.
""Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,"" he said.
Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project ""could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen"".
He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama.
Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban.
If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay.

19882153,"He quit despite surviving a vote on an opposition motion to remove him.
Mr Slipper is accused of sexual harassment by a former staff member, and of sending lurid text messages, now revealed in court documents.
His resignation could harm Ms Gillard's slender majority, which relies on votes from independent MPs.
Mr Slipper defected from opposition leader Tony Abbot's Liberal Party last year, becoming an independent.
He was swiftly promoted to the non-voting role of Speaker, freeing up his predecessor - Labour member Harry Jenkins - and effectively giving Ms Gillard a two-seat majority in the House.
His resignation now means Ms Gillard is dependent on Mr Slipper as an independent to help pass legislation.
Mr Slipper appeared to fight back tears in an emotional return to the House to announce his decision to resign, saying it was made with ""great sadness"" and regret.
His resignation followed a heated debate between Ms Gillard and Mr Abbot on Tuesday, with Mr Abbot accusing Mr Slipper of not being a ""fit and proper"" person for position of Speaker.
On Monday, court documents filed as part of a sexual harassment lawsuit being brought against him gave details of lurid text messages he is alleged to have sent his accuser, who is openly gay.

20975601,"A 10ft (3m) scrub python was battling to retain its grip on the wing as a plane made its way between the Australian town of Cairns and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
It held on the whole 1hr 50 min flight.
But on arrival in Port Moresby, ground crew found the snake had died.
Passengers first became aware of the reptile 20 minutes after take-off. A woman pointed out the python to fellow passengers and cabin crew.
At first only its head was visible, but as it tried to manoeuvre itself back to safety, its whole body was exposed. Time and again it tried to pull itself back into the shelter of the wing, but the wind was relentless.
The wind speed was 250mph (400km/h) and the temperature -12C.
The snake's body was hammered against the engine, leaving blood stains on the white paint.
One passenger, Robert Weber, a website designer in Cairns, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ''The people at the front were oblivious to what was going on but the passengers at the back were all totally focused on the snake and how it might have got on to the aircraft.
''There was no panic. At no time did anyone stop to consider that there might be others on board.''
The president of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, Paul Cousins, said: ''It appears as though the snake has initially crawled up inside the landing bay, maybe housed himself in there, and then crawled into the trailing ledge flap assembly.''

25014368,"The Paris St-Germain striker scored twice against Portugal on Tuesday but Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick took his side through 4-2 on aggregate.
Ibrahimovic, 32, said: ""It was probably the last attempt to reach the World Cup with the national team for me.
""A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.""
The play-off between Sweden and Portugal, who had both finished second in their qualifying groups, had been billed as a showdown between Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo - two of the best players in the world.
At the age of 32, Sweden skipper Zlatan Ibrahimovic may not have another opportunity to play in a World Cup finals.
And the tournament would represent a nadir in the Paris St-Germain striker's career. He has never scored at a finals having made two substitute appearances in 2002 and three starts in 2006.
They ended up scoring all six goals between them as Portugal won 4-2 on aggregate.
Former Inter Milan forward Ibrahimovic, who has played in two World Cups, scored eight times in qualifying, including the play-offs, and assisted another six goals - having a hand in 14 out of Sweden's 21 goals.
He told Uefa's website: ""Why did we lose? To be honest, they were better than us. We should be proud. We couldn't have done better than we did.
""Of course, we could look back at our mistakes, but these things happen. They punished our mistakes. After making it 2-1 it felt like we were on a roll, our hopes grew, but unfortunately they made it 2-2 soon afterwards.""
Real Madrid forward Ronaldo, who has scored 34 goals in 24 games this season for club and country, said: ""I just did my job, as I have been doing lately. I always try to give my best - that is always my goal.""

Cycling enthusiast Rad Wagon is recruiting people to knit 3,000 miniature ""Tour jerseys"" and wool-covered bicycle wheels.
Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting and the council was ""interested"", he said.
A similar ""mini-jersey"" idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race.
The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them.
""It's a bit copycat but we can do so much more,"" Mr Wagon said.
""The city's well-known for its knitters and 'yarn bombers' who cover everything from bikes to trees to lamp-posts. It's 'very Cambridge'.

27908841,"The live broadcast of John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer was scheduled for 15 November.
The opera set to be performed this autumn portrays the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985.
Jewish American passenger Leon Klinghoffer was killed in the attack
""I'm convinced that the opera is not anti-Semitic,"" the Met's General Manager, Peter Gelb, wrote in a statement.
""But I've also become convinced that there is genuine concern in the international Jewish community that the live transmission of The Death of Klinghoffer would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe.""
The decision was taken after discussions between Mr Gelb and the Anti-Defamation League, which represented Klinghoffer's children.
Mr Adams criticised the decision, telling Associated Press news agency the opera ""in no form condones or promotes violence, terrorism or anti-Semitism"".
The Achille Lauro had been sailing the Mediterranean on 7 October 1985 when the gang - members of a splinter group of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organisation - attacked.
During a two-day standoff, the group demanded the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners and killed Klinghoffer, 69, before throwing him overboard.
The Palestinian militants initially escaped after allowing the Achille Lauro to dock in Egypt.
Later, the US military intercepted an Egyptian plane which the hijackers were using to flee and forced it to land in Sicily, where the four hijackers were arrested.

28053793,"The UK foreign secretary announced on Twitter he had arrived in Irbil to meet Kurdish regional government officials.
He discussed ways of curbing militants' access to finance and arms.
Mr Hague, who held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki on Thursday, has warned that the country is facing an ""existential threat"".
The Iraqi authorities are desperately seeking to repel Sunni militants, led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis), which have taken control of parts of the north and west of the country.
The government has bought second-hand jet fighters from Russia and Belarus to try to stem the insurgents' advances.
The UK has ruled out any direct military help, focusing instead on providing diplomatic and humanitarian support as well as counter-terrorism co-operation.
Speaking at a press conference with Masoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan region, Mr Hague said the UK would press for action at the UN to stem the flow of arms from insurgents and stop their access to finance.
""I think it will be important in this new and deeply concerning situation to make sure that every loophole is being dealt with to make sure it is difficult for terrorist groups to use economic assets they have seized, to take advantage of the financial system,"" he said.
""I feel it will be necessary to have new and strong international agreement on how to tackle these things.""

He repeated his calls for Mr Maliki to form an ""inclusive"" government which could ""command the support"" of all Iraqis and to settle long-standing disputes with the Kurdish region over energy and resources.

The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500 in 2011.
The DHPA said if numbers continued to fall, the breed could lose its hardiness to survive on the moor.
It said demand had dropped for the ponies as pets because of the economic downturn.
The ponies were traditionally used for farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts.
Charlotte Faulkner, founder of the DHPA, said in a letter to South West Equine Protection (Swep): ""It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them.
""We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether.""
Ms Faulkner said selling ponies for riding and driving would continue.
""The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association believes the meat trade should be (used) too,"" she said. ""Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sale.""

But the director of the original movie has suggested it will only be the start of a whole new franchise.
Ivan Reitman has told Deadline.com that he wants to ""expand the Ghostbusters universe"".
According to him, that will include ""different films, TV shows, merchandise... all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment"".
Nothing is confirmed but Channing Tatum is one of the names rumoured to be up for a role.
Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot is due out in 2016 with Saturday Night Live's Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon joining Wiig and McCarthy.
Now, Sony Pictures, along with Reitman and original star Dan Aykroyd, are thought to be setting up a Ghost Corps production company which would oversee the output.
Reitman suggests that the Russo Brothers, who directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, would direct what would then be a fourth Ghostbusters film.
The writer would be Drew Pearce, who wrote Iron Man 3 and Mission Impossible 5.
Quoted by film website Deadline, Reitman said: ""Paul Feig's film will be the first version of that. He's got four of the funniest women in the world, and there will be other surprises to come.
""Drew (Pearce) will start writing and the hope is to be ready for the Russo Brothers' next window next summer to shoot, with the movie coming out the following year. It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies.""

Eurosceptic Tories fear the rules are being amended to allow the government to campaign openly to stay in the EU.
But ministers say it is needed to allow them to continue their work.
The committee, headed by Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, said the purdah probe would form the first part of a wide-ranging inquiry into the EU Referendum Bill, the proposed law that will authorise a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU by the end of 2017.
Mr Jenkin said he and his colleagues wanted to know why the government was planning to partially ""disapply"" the existing rules on government announcements in the four weeks leading up to the referendum.
The inquiry will focus on the existing rules, as set out in the 2000 Political Parties and Referendum Act, the government's case for amending them, how ministers plan to go about it and the impact it will have on the impartiality of the civil service.
In a vote on the issue last month, 27 Conservative MPs rebelled against their party, urging ministers to reinstate the full purdah period although the government won the vote after Labour abstained.
The government has said the existing rules would potentially prevent ministers from attending EU meetings and making decisions with a European dimension.

Staff at the University Hospital of North Durham said her comments had a ""devastating"" effect on the department.

During the hearing in Kennington, South London, one of the victims said in a statement she was angry and in disbelief and ""went to have a little cry"" after the incident.

Mr Polin sent an email to North Wales force employees responding to a UK government statement that by 2020 the Home Office would have only half of the funds it had in 2010.
He said: ""The police service represents the largest slice of the Home Office budget and therefore it is a realistic assumption that we will bear the brunt of any such reduction.

34982684,"Valentine, who had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, died ""peacefully"" in the early hours of Wednesday morning, his agent Derek Webster said.
In the BBC's World War Two drama series Colditz, he played Luftwaffe officer Major Mohn and the title role of the aristocrat jewel thief AJ Raffles.
Valentine was also known as a theatre and film actor, director and writer.
Mr Webster described him as ""brilliant"" and ""talented"".
""In 2012 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In spite of this diagnosis his sense of humour never failed him and he continued to live a full and happy life,"" he added.
Valentine's wife, the actress Susan Skipper, said: ""Tony was my best friend and it was a privilege to know, love and care for him.""
The couple first met on Yorkshire Television's Raffles and then appeared together three years later on the television film of Ivor Novello's show The Dancing Years. They married in 1982.
As well as his starring role in Colditz - which centred around the inmates of the notorious German prisoner-of-war camp - and Raffles, Valentine was also known for playing the character of upper-class thug Toby Meres in the secret agent drama series Callan, starring Edward Woodward.
The actor was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, but went to school in London. He began his acting career at the early age of 10 and appeared in several BBC children's TV shows, including an adaptation of the classic Billy Bunter stories.
He worked pretty much continuously from the 1950s and had roles in TV dramas throughout the decades, including Lovejoy, New Tricks, The Detectives, Heartbeat, Casualty and Coronation Street.
His last TV role was as a voice actor for the animated series Chuggington: Badge Quest in 2011.

The High Court in Edinburgh heard Mr Abboud told officers that Ms Szefler's temper changed just before she had her period and that she often threw household items at him during this time.

Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity.
Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that AI was humanity's ""biggest existential threat"".
Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially ""re-design itself at an ever increasing rate"", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.

It is then put back in an incubator to grow again until it is ready.
Researchers in Swansea hope to be among the first in the world to start using it on humans within three years.
""In simple terms, we're trying to grow new tissue using human cells,"" said Prof Iain Whitaker, consultant plastic surgeon at the Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Morriston Hospital.
""We're trialling using 3D printing which is a very exciting potential modality to make these relatively complex structures.

Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.
A service was also held at Westminster Abbey.
The national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended.
The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Gallipoli.
Since then, the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatriate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians, who honour the sacrifices of their countrymen and women in all wars.
Addressing the crowds at the dawn service, Alexander Downer, Australian high commissioner to the UK, who also laid a wreath, said: ""When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings, what it must have been like, at dawn on the water, in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath, a leaden silence about to be broken.
""We consider the enthusiasm, the courage, and the heroism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God, King and empire, for their mates, for adventure, for a world without war.""
Members of veterans' associations, service and ex-service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph.
Crowds, including Australia and New Zealand ex-pats, lined the streets to watch the ceremony which featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anthems of all three countries.

36207710,"Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday.
Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways.
Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography.
The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories.
Lee was described by his wife as a being ""loving and normal young man"".
Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his ""own strange pleasure"", they were serious matters as ""children were abused for these images to be made"".
He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that ""society would not tolerate such behaviour"".
Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community.
Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images.
Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for.
On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating.
During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images ""for perhaps the last nine years"".

36678121,"The call handling and IT system is more than Â£40m over budget and was initially due to be ready for October 2013.
An earlier attempt to introduce the system had to be abandoned.
The programme will now be phased in for some services from this summer with a national roll-out by the end of 2017.
Earlier this year, the planned June launch was pushed back to the ""summer of 2016"" after an issue that caused computer screens to appear blank.
It followed an earlier incident in which the system crashed and staff had to resort to pen and paper to deal with patient calls.
The new technology is meant to make NHS 24 more efficient but is expected to cost Â£117m, more than 50% higher than the original estimate.
NHS 24 said the new telephone system would be in place this year for services including Breathing Space, NHS Living Life, the musculoskeletal helpline, death certification, blood transfusion and Fit For Work.
It will then be introduced in one health board area to ensure it is working effectively before the national roll-out.
NHS 24 chief executive Angiolina Foster said: ""We expect to have a functioning technology system tested and available later in the summer.
""However, we have recognised that ensuring our staff and operational environment are also fully ready to accept the technology is absolutely essential to making sure we can make a smooth transition to the new system.""
Ms Foster said: ""We recognise that the past 18 months have been challenging for the organisation and know that the professionalism and dedication of our people has enabled us to give high-quality care to patients during this time.""
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: ""While any delays to implementation are disappointing, patient safety must always come first. This is why NHS 24 has taken the decision to phase the roll-out of its Future Programme.
""This decision follows a comprehensive review of the new system which concluded that a phased roll-out later this summer, working towards full implementation across all health boards by the end of 2017, would be both safe for patients and deliverable by the organisation.""",reconstructable,A crisis-hit computer project for the NHS 24 telephone helpline will not be fully rolled out across Scotland until the end of next year - four years later than originally planned.,The roll-out of a new telephone system for NHS 24 has been delayed for a second time.,-0.4096832275390625,0.22568923234939575

36970220,"Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city.
Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died and more than 20 were hospitalised after Tuesday's attack.
There has been no independent confirmation of the claim.
It comes after reports from a rebel-held town in Idlib province that chlorine gas was dropped on it late on Monday after a Russian military helicopter had earlier been shot down nearby.
A battle has continued since the weekend in Aleppo, as rebels attempt to break a government siege of a rebel-controlled area.
It is expected to be decisive for the future of a city that was once a commercial heartland but has been destroyed by five years of war.
About a quarter of a million civilians are living under siege since government forces cut them off last month.
The latest reports from the area are that the government, backed by Russian jets, has regained some ground. It is not clear exactly which territory has returned to government control but a reporter for a Beirut-based TV station said the army had regained control of two out of three villages that it lost near Aleppo earlier this week.
Russian and Syrian forces say they have been operating seven so-called humanitarian corridors, allowing hundreds of people to leave the besieged area peacefully.
On Wednesday, Russian state television ran pictures of civilians and fighters leaving. Smoke was seen billowing over the city in the footage, and gunshots were heard.
The UN's Children's Fund (Unicef) said it is ""extremely"" concerned for the safety of children caught up in violence in the city.
Saad Houry, of the fund, said children make up a third of the population trapped in the siege, and called for unhindered humanitarian access and for children to be protected.
The New York-based Physicians for Human Rights group said the last week of July was the worst week for attacks on medical facilities in the region since the Syrian war began in 2011. In a statement, the group said it has verified six deadly air strikes against hospitals in Aleppo governorate, all perpetrated by Syrian government forces.

A spokesman for Yemen's rebel Houthi movement told the Saba news agency that it had not targeted any warships.
The incident came eight days after an attack on an Emirati civilian ship that was also blamed on the Houthis.
The UAE government said the high-speed catamaran was carrying aid, wounded Yemenis and passengers when it was hit in the Bab al-Mandab strait.
US Naval Forces Central Command spokeswoman Paula Dunn said in a statement on Monday that the USS Mason had been ""conducting routine operations in international waters"" north of the strait when it ""detected two inbound missiles"" around 19:00 (16:00 GMT) on Sunday.
""Both missiles impacted the water before reaching the ship,"" Ms Dunn said, adding that ""there were no injuries to our sailors and no damage to the ship"".
""We assess these missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled territory.""
However, a Houthi military spokesman told Saba that the charge was ""baseless and aimed to cover for the heinous Saudi crime of Saturday's air attacks on the civilian funeral hall in the capital Sanaa"", which killed more than 140 people.
A Saudi-led multinational coalition, whose air campaign against the Houthis and their allies is supported by the US, has denied any responsibility.

In 1929, the North East Coast Exhibition was opened by the Prince of Wales in Newcastle amid great fanfare.
So, will organisers take inspiration from the grand event, which attracted four million visitors?
Responding to the Newcastle and Gateshead announcement, the North East Chamber of Commerce said: ""The Great Exhibition looks set to be the launch pad of real growth in our regional economy.""
The Prince of Wales - later King Edward VIII - opened the 1929 event and said: ""The industries of the North are not yet knocked out of the ring.
""They are fighting back gallantly with a good Northern punch.""
And the ""northern punch"" included cutting-edge technology, such as a cow milking machine, a telescope brought down from Edinburgh University, and the local newspaper using a newly-designed electric sign to flash out the latest news items.
Industry and consumer items were represented, some of them household names that remain, such as Hoover vacuum cleaners, Singer sewing machines, and Pyrex glass ovenware.
Andrews Liver Salts showed off its brand with a 15ft ""fountain of health"".
For entertainment there was an amusement park, a Himalayan Railway, and an African village.
More than four million people passed through the turnstiles between May and October that year, including King Alfonso of Spain and the Sultan of Zanzibar. Each millionth visitor was presented with a gold watch.
When the exhibition ended, the pavilions were dismantled and the area reverted to a public park.

The suspect, described as a member of the extremist Reichsbuerger movement, opened fire on the officers before he was eventually detained.
Officials said a permit had been revoked for the 31 guns he owned.
Local authorities had called in the police after the man repeatedly refused to co-operate with them. When a special forces team moved in early on Wednesday he began shooting through his door, officials said.
Police confirmed the officer's death on Thursday, having announced it prematurely late on Wednesday. Another policeman is being treated for serious gunshot wounds. Two others were lightly wounded.
The gunman was lightly injured in the exchange.
The Reichsbuerger (""Reich Citizens"") group does not recognise the authority of the post-war German federal republic, seeing it merely as some sort of private company. It believes in the continued existence of a German empire, or Reich, dating back to 1937 or even earlier.
Its roots are said to go back some three decades.
Bavarian officials said the group's ideology was ""nationalist and anti-Semitic.... clearly extreme right"". Their circle had grown in recently years, they said, and included ""whingers, nutcases, conspiracy theorists, but also the far-right"".
The diversity of beliefs and views within the group militates against a simple hierarchical structure or clear leadership.

It will also be key for driverless technology.
Samsung said automotive electronics was ""a strategic priority"".
The deal is the biggest overseas purchase made by a South Korean firm, and comes as Samsung is looking to recover from the withdrawal of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.
It is estimated that the so-called connected technologies market, which goes under the Internet of Things umbrella, will grow to $100bn by 2025.
Cars will be a major part of this growth, with technology research firm Gartner forecasting that by 2020 one in five vehicles will have some sort of wireless network connection.
Features being working on include in-car monitors assessing drivers' health as they travel, and automatic leaving and arriving alerts for friends and family. However, campaigners have highlighted potential data privacy issues around connected vehicles.
""The vehicle of tomorrow will be transformed by smart technology and connectivity in the same way that simple feature phones have become sophisticated smart devices over the past decade,"" Young Sohn, Samsung's president and chief strategy officer, said in a statement.
The purchase comes in the wake of the Galaxy Note 7 episode, which saw both Samsung's reputation and profits harmed after it was forced to recall, then end production of the device, because it turned out to be a fire hazard.
Samsung generates the bulk of its revenues from its smartphone business, but is now looking for new areas of growth.

It will also look at the possible implications for civil and family law, and commercial issues.
The meeting, which will also include experts from the Scottish Universities Legal Network on Europe and the Standing Council on Europe, is due to take place in Edinburgh on 24 November.
Mr Matheson said: ""The UK Brexit vote raises many uncertainties for Scotland's unique justice system.
""That is why I am bringing together leaders and experts to help us understand these issues - and any steps we can take now to mitigate the risks.
""The cessation of EU membership and single market access would have significant and wide-ranging ramifications from a justice and legal perspective.

Sky will become a ""quad play"" provider, offering broadband, television fixed-line telephone and a mobile service.
And existing Sky TV customers will not have to pay for calls or texts and can compile playlists of their favourite shows to watch on their mobiles.
According to Sky, some 46,000 have pre-registered for the service.
The service comes with three data plans:
Non-Sky TV customers can add on unlimited calls and texts for £10 per month, or pay for calls and texts on a pay-as-you-use (PAYU) basis.
According to Sky, UK consumers use less than half of the mobile data they buy from mobile network operators, adding up to an annual £2bn of wasted data.
Stephen van Rooyen, UK and Ireland Sky chief executive, said:  ""We felt it was time to shake up the mobile market and give customers a completely new way to manage their mobile plan.

39053929,"There were about 19,000 diagnoses in 2015, compared to about 17,300 in 2006.
Public Health Wales (PHW) said the main reason for the increase was an ageing population.
The organisation's Dr Dyfed Wyn Huws said there was ""good news"" by way of significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.
There was a year-on-year decrease from about 19,800 cases in 2014, but the 2015 figure of 19,088 is likely to increase as statisticians revise the numbers.
Once age factors are taken into account, the rate decreased by more than 5% in men, but increased by more than 5% among women between 2006 and 2015.
This is partly due to the rate of lung cancer going down in men, but up among women. Historically, smoking rates peaked far earlier among men than women.
Breast, prostate, lung and bowel cancers remain the most common.
According to PHW, cases of liver, mouth, throat and melanoma skin cancer saw the biggest percentage increases.
The rates of stomach cancer and prostate cancer decreased, while mesothelioma rates increased by almost a third.
Dr Huws said: ""We know that up to four in 10 of cancers in the population may be preventable.
""With an increasing number of cancer cases each year, cancer control is possible and important for future generations and for keeping rising health service demand in check.
""The good news is that we have seen significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.

In a new BBC Wales poll, 79% of those surveyed said they would increase charges for visitors from outside the UK for using the health service.
But Mr Gething said such charges were a ""marginal area"" of NHS activity.
Speaking to The Wales Report on Wednesday, he said: ""We have reciprocal arrangements with most European countries, and as long as those reciprocal arrangements work I see no reason to intervene and change those.
""However for people outside the UK and Europe where we don't have those, we're looking again at charging arrangements.""
""Later in the year I'll get to make a decision on what charging may or may not look like.""
But the health secretary added: ""This is such a marginal area of activity.""
""Really, when you're talking about the central funding of the health service, with the big challenge that we face, the actual conversation about charging people from abroad is an absolute distraction.""
Asked whether he would consider charging patients who have illnesses caused by their lifestyle choices, Mr Gething said: ""If you're really saying, for example, that someone with lung cancer who smoked should therefore be charged for their treatment.
""I actually think that when you get into real examples like that, people will very quickly say that isn't what I think should happen.
""When you think about the practical reality of it, it isn't that simple at all.""
Mr Gething warned while the Welsh Government had made ""significant additional commitments"" to the health service from its budget, there would be difficult consequences if austerity continues across the UK.

Emails outlining the original terms were leaked to campaign organisation 38 Degrees.
Gordon Maloney from the group said it was an ""outrageous way for MooBoo Bubble Tea to exploit people looking for work"".

On Saturday, Disney - quite uncharacteristically - gave us a bit of an insight into how they plan to use technology to bring their much-loved brand of storytelling to new forms, by using robotics and artificial intelligence.
Jon Snoddy, the company's senior Vice President for research and development, explained how soon you’ll be able to interact with story-telling robots at Disney parks.
“I think AI [artificial intelligence] and machine learning is going to be very important for what we do,” he told the BBC.
""Things like characters that can move around among our guests. They’re going to need to understand where they’re going, have goals, and they’re going to have to know how to navigate in a world with humans.
""All these emerging technologies are going to be key to the next generation of entertainment.”
Robotic Pascal
During a panel discussion, the company shared footage - which unfortunately we’re not able republish here - of a robotic Pascal, the cute lizard from 2010 movie Tangled.
It’s a terrific recreation of the digital character, but the real challenge for Disney will be to avoid the so-called “uncanny valley” - the theory that if something is very lifelike, but not exactly right, it can be slightly creepy or disturbing.
""Obviously we’re not the business of scaring kids!” Mr Snoddy said.
""That won’t be part of what we deploy. We go and do tests in our parks to gauge the reaction and try and understand what kids find entertaining about these things. Our ability to build these characters at a fidelity that looks like the films is really growing.”
When these technologies are fully deployed in Disney parks, and perhaps as toys, Mr Snoddy said Disney will do everything it can to hide the inner technological workings.
""Every new technology that’s come along for the last 60, 70 years we have adopted and co-opted and made it into a story telling medium,” he said.
""This won’t be different. We’re not going to put up a sign that says 'Look! Artificial intelligence', because no-one would come to see that.

The board is debating whether to suspend the entire Russian team from the Games following a doping scandal.
""I apologise unreservedly for any offence I have caused. I am truly sorry,"" Franco Kasper said.
The International Ski Federation President was discussing a proposed blanket ban on Russian athletes when he made the Holocaust comment, referring to the World War II genocide that saw six million Jews killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.
He reportedly said: ""I'm just against bans or sanctioning of innocent people. Like Mr Hitler did - all Jews were to be killed, independently of what they did or did not do.""
When challenged by reporters at the time, Franco Kasper responded: ""Why not? Of course it's more extreme. But just the fact that the place you come from makes you guilty, I'm not OK for this, really not.""

But last year Local Government Secretary Sajiv Javid refused to accept the decision.
Planning judge Mr Justice Gilbart ruled that Mr Javid's decision was fatally inconsistent and ""plainly deficient"".
The case will now have to be reconsidered.
Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, quashed the refusal, saying: ""The secretary of state has performed a complete and unexplained volte-face in his assessment of the highways impacts of two proposals for development on the same site in Newmarket and has also failed to apply his own National Planning Policy Framework.""
The judge said: ""There is on any view a requirement for more land for housing and other economic development in the Forest Heath District.""
Edward Stanley, the 19th Earl of Derby, brought the legal challenge with Moulton Parish Council and the Rural Parishes Alliance.
The judge said local parish councils had for some time argued that growth in the area should not be dispersed among the rural parishes but concentrated in Newmarket.
Newmarket Horsemen's Group and some others were concerned that development in the town ""may have an adverse effect on the horseracing industry that is based there"" and lead to increased traffic.

The lorry's trailer was also incinerated and the burnt-out wreck ended up a short distance ahead of the bus. The German news website Frankenpost reports that it was carrying mattresses and pillows.
The lorry driver was unharmed and told police the bus had gone into the back of his vehicle and burst into flames, it said.
