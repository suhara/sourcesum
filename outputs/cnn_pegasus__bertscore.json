The 43-year-old German is the second driver in F1 history, after Brazil's Rubens Barrichello, to achieve the feat and will be hoping for an upturn in his fortunes in his Mercedes. A superb podium finish at the European Grand Prix has been mixed with retirements in six of 10 races this season and Schumacher is confident he can turn it around on his favorite circuit. \"Spa is like my living room; for me, it's clearly the number one race track in the world,\" Schumacher told the official F1 website. \"It's uncanny how I always seem to have special moments there -- my debut, my first win, a world championship victory and many great races. \"We delivered a good performance in Spa last year; I'll be doing everything possible to drive a strong race,\" he added. Schumacher's first appearance in F1 came at Spa in 1991 for Jordan before he moved to Benetton to win successive titles in 1994 and 1995. He switched to Ferrari the next year and won five further titles with the famous marque before retiring in 2006.

A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors.

According to the Daily Telegraph he told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme:\u00a0'We used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated. 'People are checking their emails all the time, you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be.' In his book, Prof Spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own. Passion killed: People are check their emails 'all the time', according to\u00a0Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University (file picture) But he added: 'A more realistic explanation is that as we\u2019ve become better connected technologically, our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home, work and the outside world. This has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves. The statistician quotes Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, as saying: \u2018With an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.\u2019 She adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that \u2018come bedtime, we\u2019re just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner.\u2019", "ref_summary": "Typical heterosexual couples in Britain are having sex three times a month .\nThe figure in 2000 was four times a month and five times a month in 1990 .\nLeading statistician says couples are checking their emails 'all the time'", "gen_summary": "This was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990.", "summary_idx": 2, "rel_sent_positions": [5]}, {"id": "xsum__validation__39ab847c4b1648735705a021d4f25b86ef25b8e7__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "validation", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "39ab847c4b1648735705a021d4f25b86ef25b8e7", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Martin Skrtel showed that he's fully recovered from the injury scare that forced him off in Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final clash with Blackburn by posing for a photo in Monte Carlo - while wearing a \u00a3260 Givenchy t-shirt.", "pos": [0, 223], "label": [1, 1], "bertscore": 0.9013310074806213}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "The centre back was taken off on a stretcher in the first minute after a clash with Rudy Gestede left the Slovakian flat out on the Anfield pitch.", "pos": [224, 370], "label": [1, 1], "bertscore": 0.881648063659668}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "Skrtel took to Instagram where he posted the snap of himself and wife Bara enjoying some time away from England.", "pos": [371, 483], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8607603907585144}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Martin Skrtel posted this image on his Instagram alongside his wife Bara in Monte Carlo, Monaco .", "pos": [484, 581], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8606730699539185}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "The centre back was knocked unconscious and required eight minutes of treatment before being substituted .", "pos": [582, 688], "label": [0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8623088002204895}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "Skrtel is currently on a short-break in sunny Monte Carlo, Monaco, before he'll return to help Liverpool in their quest to finish in the Champions League qualification places.", "pos": [689, 864], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8655719757080078}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "Liverpool travel to Swansea a week on Monday, knowing that a win is vital if they want to keep the pressure on Manchester United and Arsenal.", "pos": [865, 1006], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8434033393859863}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "Brendan Rodgers side have won their last three meetings with the Welsh outfit and scored an impressive ten goals.", "pos": [1007, 1120], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8495984673500061}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "The last time the two sides met, the Reds comfortably won 4-1 including a double from Adam Lallana and ex-Liverpool man Jonjo Shelvey's own goal.", "pos": [1121, 1266], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8477963209152222}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Emre Can (centre) calls over to the Liverpool bench for medical attention after Skrtel's injury .", "pos": [1267, 1364], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8864672780036926}], "summary_label": [1, 1], "document": "Martin Skrtel showed that he's fully recovered from the injury scare that forced him off in Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final clash with Blackburn by posing for a photo in Monte Carlo - while wearing a \u00a3260 Givenchy t-shirt.

It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised.

But the Lions declined to take up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract and did not exactly bend over backwards to retain his services. A history of inconsistency, injuries and off-field concerns led the Lions to allow him enter free agency.

Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!'

The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend.

Young, who did not testify in his own defense, is charged with complicity to murder for his alleged role in the slaying of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011. Prosecutors say the 17-year-old acted in concert with his father, Josh Gouker, to kill Zwicker, 14. Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's defense attorneys argue that Gouker acted alone in killing Zwicker. Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him \"very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed.\" The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions. \"They were sitting together on the couch, playing video games.

Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: \u2018British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. \u2018Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.\u2019 Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: \u2018The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.\u2019 As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden \u2013 and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth \u00a31,928. And around 57 per cent of householders surveyed by Lloyds TSB said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.", "ref_summary": "Now outdoor space is more commonly used to store hot tubs, say experts .\nOnly traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens as a result .\nMost only contains four species - daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips .", "gen_summary": "Average one usually contains a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips.", "summary_idx": 3, "rel_sent_positions": [3, 9]}, {"id": "xsum__test__96dab028bb00fdeaf3a8f594250415b33b46bbcb__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "test", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "96dab028bb00fdeaf3a8f594250415b33b46bbcb", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris.", "pos": [0, 114], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8728314638137817}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a \u00a335million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors, while the north London club are determined not to sell the Frenchman to a domestic rival.", "pos": [115, 345], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.846136748790741}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "United are considering a move for the France goalkeeper as fears grow over a David de Gea's future, while he is also a long-term target for Paris Saint-Germain.", "pos": [346, 506], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8499466180801392}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Hugo Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's top keepers with some fine displays .", "pos": [507, 611], "label": [1, 1, 1], "bertscore": 0.9771538972854614}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Spurs are determined to keep Lloris at White Hart Lane and will put a \u00a335million price tag on his head .", "pos": [612, 716], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8695096373558044}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "But Spurs are determined to keep their No 1 at White Hart Lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper.", "pos": [717, 828], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8598697781562805}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "The current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the \u00a332.6million Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001.", "pos": [829, 953], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.853234589099884}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "But Tottenham chairman Levy values Lloris even higher than that fee and won't consider any offers for a penny under \u00a335million.", "pos": [954, 1081], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8656534552574158}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "And it is for that reason United, despite their interest, are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch.", "pos": [1082, 1196], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8500542044639587}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Daniel Levy (right), alongside Spurs owner Joe Lewis, is known to drive a hard bargain .", "pos": [1197, 1285], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8529266715049744}, {"sentence_idx": 10, "sentence": "Gianluigi Buffon is the world's most expensive keeper after his \u00a332.6m move from Parma to Juve in 2001 .", "pos": [1286, 1390], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8629257678985596}, {"sentence_idx": 11, "sentence": "Levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in Europe and will not let Lloris leave on someone else's terms.", "pos": [1391, 1507], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.886677086353302}, {"sentence_idx": 12, "sentence": "His reputation for getting maximum value from the club's assets was underlined when Real Madrid paid a world record \u00a385million for Gareth Bale after a summer of hardball tactics from Levy.", "pos": [1508, 1696], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8520845174789429}, {"sentence_idx": 13, "sentence": "And the Spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep Lloris, who signed a five-year deal last summer.", "pos": [1697, 1820], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8752851486206055}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris.

The group of friends then reportedly went on a shopping spree after the mass giveaway, which began last Wednesday at the town's Claggett Middle School.

Medina police told the Akron Beacon Journal\u00a0that the boy, who lives with his 83-year-old grandpa and his mom, swiped the money from the senior's bedside table.

Dollar: The children, and adults who were also given money, went on a spending spree. Some $7,000 has been recovered . As of Saturday, police had recovered some $7,000 of the man's savings, as well as some of the items the boy and his friends had bought with it.

David Beckham was accompanied by his wife Victoria on Sunday night, as he hosted the launch of London's pop-up Haig Club, in support of his recently-launched whisky brand . Ex-United man Beckham uploaded an image of himself en route to the pop-up bar at Wellington Arch . When it was announced in April 2014 that Beckham was going to release the new brand of whisky, he said: . 'The House of Haig has a rich history and I'm proud to be working at the heart of a home-grown brand which has built an incredible heritage over 400 years.' Meanwhile, Beckham's son Brooklyn was in attendance at Wembley for Chelsea's Capital One Cup victory over Tottenham. The father-of-four posed by the bar, which will offer a variety of specially-crafted cocktails for one week . As his parents were at the whisky launch, Brooklyn Beckham attended the Capital One Cup final at Wembley .

Jonathan's official declaration comes three days after he informally announced on Facebook that he intended to run in the primaries, which will be held between October 18 and 20, according PDP spokesman Rufai Alkali. \"In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian,\" Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday. He took a more confident stance Saturday, announcing that under his presidency, all petrol refineries are now working, the banking sector has been reformed, electricity has been stablized and steps have been taken to fix roads, water, education and food production. He also said he has set in progress free and fair elections. Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the People's Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian \"zoning\" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north.

Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. \"Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,\" Earnest said. \"He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.\" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013. When he was questioned by the FBI at the time, he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to court documents. Earnest says he is unaware of any particular security precautions put in place by the White House when it consults with Petraeus, despite his legal problems and lack of CIA security clearance. Petraeus is currently the chairman of a global institute for private equity firm KKR.", "ref_summary": "The Obama administration has consulted with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS .\nPetraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month .", "gen_summary": "The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS.", "summary_idx": 1, "rel_sent_positions": [2]}, {"id": "xsum__train__afe6872d866d160cc99f402cf65c57af273dadb5__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "train", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "afe6872d866d160cc99f402cf65c57af273dadb5", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "(CNN) --", "pos": [0, 8], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8072852492332458}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "Even though Hurricane Irene has been downgraded to a tropical storm, its powerful winds and drenching rain continue to pose danger to people who venture into it, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Sunday.", "pos": [9, 235], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8583366870880127}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "People should \"stay inside, stay safe,\" FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program.", "pos": [236, 348], "label": [1, 1], "bertscore": 0.8598114252090454}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "\"For a lot of folks, the danger still exists.", "pos": [349, 394], "label": [1, 1], "bertscore": 0.9527279138565063}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "We still will have trees coming down, heavy rain, strong winds.\"", "pos": [395, 459], "label": [0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8582488894462585}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "Hundreds of thousands of people have lost electrical power, and it will take time to get it all restored, Fugate warned.", "pos": [460, 580], "label": [0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8736089468002319}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "\"I think some people will get power back rather quickly, but other people, it's going to be days,\" he said on the NBC program \"Meet the Press.\"", "pos": [581, 724], "label": [0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8552181720733643}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "In addition, Fugate said anyone evacuated in the storm that made landfall twice -- first in North Carolina on Saturday and again in New Jersey on Sunday -- should avoid returning to their homes until floodwaters have receded and emergency crews have cleared fallen trees and downed power lines.", "pos": [725, 1019], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8343824744224548}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "\"Don't go back yet.", "pos": [1020, 1039], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8622433543205261}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "Let local officials give you the all clear,\" Fugate said.", "pos": [1040, 1097], "label": [0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8708343505859375}], "summary_label": [1, 1], "document": "(CNN) -- Even though Hurricane Irene has been downgraded to a tropical storm, its powerful winds and drenching rain continue to pose danger to people who venture into it, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Sunday.

Overseas, a French blogger was fined the equivalent of about $3,200 after a negative review of a restaurant began surfacing prominently in Google searches.", "ref_summary": "California law bans restaurants from targeting bad reviews .\nReviews on Yelp and elsewhere can't lead to fines .\nA New York site had a $500 fine for bad reviews from wedding parties .", "gen_summary": "New law appears to be the first of its kind.", "summary_idx": 2, "rel_sent_positions": [4]}, {"id": "xsum__test__c176c98ca82117c585faf1078844f111d8756aa5__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "test", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "c176c98ca82117c585faf1078844f111d8756aa5", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Carl Froch's dream of a swansong fight in Las Vegas against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr looks to have gone up in smoke after the former middleweight world champion was stopped in nine rounds by Andrzej Fonfara.", "pos": [0, 204], "label": [1, 1, 1], "bertscore": 0.9123377799987793}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "Froch has repeatedly expressed a desire to finish a glittering career with a lucrative bout in the fight capital of the world against the Mexican, and has said he may retire if that fight does not come to fruition.", "pos": [205, 419], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8195030689239502}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "The 37-year-old super-middleweight, who has not fought since knocking out George Groves in their re-match at Wembley last May, had hoped to be back in action last month against Chavez but an elbow injury scuppered his plans.", "pos": [420, 644], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8207393884658813}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "Former middleweight world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr was stopped in nine rounds by Andrzej Fonfara .", "pos": [645, 749], "label": [0, 0, 1], "bertscore": 0.9538648724555969}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "Carl Froch has expressed his desire to fight Chavez Jr (right) in Las Vegas but that now looks unlikely .", "pos": [750, 855], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.836055338382721}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "Chavez instead took on Fonfara in a light-heavyweight bout at StubHub Center in Carson, California, but was thoroughly outclassed by his Polish opponent.", "pos": [856, 1009], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8679012060165405}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "Chavez was knocked down in the ninth and although he managed to survive until the end of the round, the decision was taken to pull him out as he slipped to his second career defeat.", "pos": [1010, 1191], "label": [0, 1, 1], "bertscore": 0.8396331667900085}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "Chavez took on Fonfara at StubHub Center in California, but was thoroughly outclassed by the Polish fighter .", "pos": [1192, 1301], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8740572333335876}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "Froch (left) has not fought since knocking out George Groves at Wembley Stadium in a re-match last May .", "pos": [1302, 1406], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8272421956062317}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Carl Froch's dream of a swansong fight in Las Vegas against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr looks to have gone up in smoke after the former middleweight world champion was stopped in nine rounds by Andrzej Fonfara.

Tehran agreed to halt the country's nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran's economy. Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn't \"have the luxury of testing these propositions\" in the deal. \"But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them,\" Obama said. That, he said, should be \"sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table,\" he said. The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060, limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections.

Antonio Valencia was poor for Manchester United on Monday night and was at fault for two goals . The midfielder-cum-defender inexplicably let Danny Welbeck in for the winner with an awful backpass . Nacho Monreal (left) scored Arsenal's first, with Valencia involved in the defensive collpase . Valencia posted this lengthy apologies to his team-mates and supporters after the defeat by Arsenal . Valencia was panned by fans and television pundits alike for his awful performance, and the 29-year-old has now offered up an apology for his showing. 'I want to apologise to my team-mates and the fans of Manchester United,' Valencia said on Instagram. 'Tomorrow is another day and keep working,' he added before tagging team-mates Marcos Rojo, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, Rafael and Robin van Persie in the message. Valencia tries to get close to Chile winger Alexis Sanchez during Monday night's FA Cup defeat . Former United captain Roy Keane called Valencia's defensive contribution 'disgraceful' and accused the Ecuadorian of 'downing tools' in his television analysis. And things got even worse for Van Gaal's first choice at right back on Tuesday when Rafael put in a brilliant - and goalscoring - performance for United's Under 21s to pile the pressure on Valencia ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur. Rafael (left) was excellent for United's Under 21s, scoring and looking a viable alternative to Valencia .", "ref_summary": "Antonia Valencia has apologised for  Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal .\nValencia was at fault for both goals, including Danny Welbeck's winner .\nRoy Keane called the midfielder-cum-defender 'disgraceful' in his analysis .\nRafael put pressure on Valencia's position with a goal for United Under 21s .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news .", "gen_summary": "The Ecuadorian has now apologised to his team-mates and fans.", "summary_idx": 2, "rel_sent_positions": [1, 9]}, {"id": "xsum__train__f22c17e8d0804198fc69896eb897fecdbc851f6d__pegasus-xsum__0", "corpus": "cnn_dailymail", "split": "train", "model": "pegasus-xsum", "original_id": "f22c17e8d0804198fc69896eb897fecdbc851f6d", "annotations": [{"sentence_idx": 0, "sentence": "Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday for demanding changes on the island in order to improve bilateral relations and referred to him as \"stupid.\"", "pos": [0, 217], "label": [0, 0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8559386134147644}, {"sentence_idx": 1, "sentence": "On Wednesday, Obama told Hispanic journalists that he would be willing to change the country's tough line on Cuba \"when we start seeing a serious intention on the part of the Cuban government to provide liberty for its people.\"", "pos": [218, 445], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8577735424041748}, {"sentence_idx": 2, "sentence": "On Thursday, Castro responded with sarcasm in a written essay published in Cuban state media.", "pos": [446, 539], "label": [1, 1, 1], "bertscore": 0.9771942496299744}, {"sentence_idx": 3, "sentence": "\"How nice!", "pos": [540, 550], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8457803130149841}, {"sentence_idx": 4, "sentence": "How intelligent!", "pos": [551, 567], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8518591523170471}, {"sentence_idx": 5, "sentence": "So much generosity has failed to let him understand that after 50 years of blockade and crimes against our country, they haven't been able to bow our people.\"", "pos": [568, 726], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.835111141204834}, {"sentence_idx": 6, "sentence": "He went on to say many things would change in Cuba, but only thanks to Cubans' own efforts and \"despite\" the United States.", "pos": [727, 850], "label": [0, 0, 1], "bertscore": 0.8662485480308533}, {"sentence_idx": 7, "sentence": "\"Perhaps that empire will collapse first,\" he added.", "pos": [851, 903], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8581073880195618}, {"sentence_idx": 8, "sentence": "He also slammed a recent ruling by a U.S. judge against a Cuban agent, but he said it was to be expected.", "pos": [904, 1009], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8702143430709839}, {"sentence_idx": 9, "sentence": "\"Otherwise, the empire would cease to be the empire and Obama would cease to be stupid.\"", "pos": [1010, 1098], "label": [0, 0, 0], "bertscore": 0.8509758710861206}], "summary_label": [1, 1, 1], "document": "Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday for demanding changes on the island in order to improve bilateral relations and referred to him as \"stupid.\" On Wednesday, Obama told Hispanic journalists that he would be willing to change the country's tough line on Cuba \"when we start seeing a serious intention on the part of the Cuban government to provide liberty for its people.\" On Thursday, Castro responded with sarcasm in a written essay published in Cuban state media. \"How nice!
